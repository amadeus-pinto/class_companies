Exa Corporation develops, sells, and supports simulation software and services primarily for vehicle manufacturers worldwide. The company offers PowerFLOW, a software solution for simulating complex fluid flow problems, including aerodynamics, thermal management, aeroacoustics, or wind noise. Its software suite comprises PowerDELTA with PowerCLAY that streamlines and automates simulation model preparation process; PowerCASE, which creates, edits, and compiles a complete PowerFLOW simulation case that controls the construction of the simulation grid; PowerTHERM with PowerFLOW, which is used to predict surface temperatures and heat fluxes generated by thermal radiation and conduction; and PowerCOOL with PowerFLOW that is used to calculate the heat transfer between a heat exchanger and the cooling airflow. The company also provides PowerINSIGHT, a graphical user interface, which provides a library of user configurable templates; PowerVIZ, a visualization and analysis application for processing simulation results; PowerACOUSTICS that enables pressure fluctuation prediction, noise source identification, wind noise transmission to interior, and sound package parameter study capabilities; PowerREALITY that enables photo-realistic engineering and design communication of PowerFLOW simulation results; and ExaCLOUD, which offers PowerFLOW simulation preparation and analysis functionality through a browser, as well as manages the simulation server in the cloud. Its products are used in various applications, such as aerodynamics, thermal management, aeroacoustics, climate control, and powertrain, as well as provide consulting and training services. The company serves aerospace, oil and gas production, chemical processing, architecture, engineering and construction, power generation, biomedical, and electronics industries through direct sales force, distributors, and sales agents. Exa Corporation was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts.
