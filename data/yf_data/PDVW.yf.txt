pdvWireless, Inc. operates as a private wireless communications carrier, and provider of mobile workforce communication and location based solutions in the United States. Its solutions focuses on enhancing the productivity of its customers field-based workers, and the efficiency of their dispatch and call center operations. The company is deploying and operating dedicated, wide-area, two-way radio networks that offer private push-to-talk (PTT) communications services to primarily dispatch-centric, small and medium-sized businesses in construction, distribution, transportation, field services, waste management, and hospitality industries. It offers DispatchPlus service, which combines pdvConnect, a proprietary suite of mobile communication and workforce management applications with digital network architecture and mobile devices supplied by Motorola Solutions, Inc. The companys solution enables communication and response among field workers and streamlined dispatch operations through exchange of information by prioritizing messages from the field, which can reduce or eliminate wasteful on hold time. In addition, its pdvConnect allows business customers to document field incidents and activities, and to collect operational data and location based information to enhance their operations. The company primarily markets its DispatchPlus service indirectly through Motorolas dealer network and other third-party dealers, with sales, marketing, and advertising support from its internal sales and marketing team. The company was formerly known as Pacific DataVision, Inc. and changed its name to pdvWireless, Inc. in November 2015. pdvWireless, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 and is headquartered in Woodland Park, New Jersey.
