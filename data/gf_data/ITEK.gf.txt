Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Its lead product candidate, trabodenoson, is a selective adenosine mimetic that the Company has designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by restoring the eye's natural pressure control mechanism. The Company developed this molecule to selectively stimulate a particular adenosine subreceptor in the eye with the effect of augmenting the intrinsic function of the eye's trabecular meshwork (TM). Its product pipeline includes trabodenoson monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), of trabodenoson with latanoprost given once-daily (QD). The Company is evaluating the potential of trabodenoson to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases.
