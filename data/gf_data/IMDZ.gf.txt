Immune Design Corp. is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company. The Company is focused on cancer with in vivo approaches designed to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The Company has engineered its technologies to activate the immune system's natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to fight cancer. The Company is engaged in developing multiple product candidates from its two discovery platforms, ZVex and GLAAS. Its primary product candidates, CMB305 and G100, utilize multiple immuno-oncology approaches and are in multiple Phase I and Phase II trials. CMB305 is targeting the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, in which a priming agent called LV305 from its ZVex platform is dosed sequentially with an agent from its GLAAS platform. G100 leverages the range of endogenous antigens found in the tumor microenvironment, including neoantigens.
