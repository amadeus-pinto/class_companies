Chimerix, Inc. is a biotechnology company. The Company is focused on discovering, developing and commercializing medicines that address unmet medical needs. Its lead compound, brincidofovir, is in development as an oral and intravenous (IV) formulation for the prevention and treatment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses, including smallpox, adenoviruses (AdV), and the human herpesviruses. It is also advancing the development of CMX521 for the treatment and prevention of norovirus. In addition, the Company has an active discovery program focusing on viral targets for which limited or no therapies are available. Brincidofovir is an investigational oral nucleotide analog that has shown spectrum antiviral activity against all five families of double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) viruses that affect humans. Oral and IV formulations of brincidofovir are in development, both of which deliver the active antiviral directly to the site of viral replication.
