Arlington Asset Investment Corp. is an investment company. The Company focuses on acquiring and holding a levered portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS), consisting of agency MBS and private-label MBS. Agency MBS include residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a United States Government agency or government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Private-label MBS, or non-agency MBS, include residential MBS that are not guaranteed by a GSE or the United States Government. The Company funds its investments primarily through short-term financing arrangements. The Company purchases agency MBS either in initial offerings or in the secondary market through broker-dealers or similar entities. It may invest in agency MBS collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans (ARMs) or hybrid ARMs.
