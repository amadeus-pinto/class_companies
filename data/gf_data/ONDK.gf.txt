On Deck Capital, Inc. offers an online platform for small business lending. The Company's platform aggregates and analyzes data points from disparate data sources to assess the creditworthiness of small businesses.

The Company offers small businesses a suite of financing options with its term loans and lines of credit that can meet the needs of small businesses throughout their life cycle. Its internal sales force and customer service representatives provide assistance throughout the application process and the life of the loan. Its loans are priced based on a risk assessment generated by its data and analytics engine, which includes the OnDeck Score. Its platform touches every aspect of the customer life cycle, including customer acquisition, sales, scoring and underwriting, funding, and servicing and collections.
