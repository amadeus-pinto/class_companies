ANADIGICS, Inc. is engaged in the designing and manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) semiconductor solutions for infrastructure and mobile communications and data transmission markets. The Company's product portfolio includes line amplifiers, reverse path amplifiers, power amplifiers (PAs) and front-end integrated circuits (FEIC). The Company designs, develops, and manufactures RFIC's primarily using GaAs compound semiconductor substrates with various process technologies, including metal semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET), pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (pHEMT) and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). The Company's InGaP-Plus technology, combines InGaP HBT and pHEMT processes on a single substrate and integrates the PA function and the RF active switch function on the same die. Additionally, the Company offers VCSEL process technology. The Company fabricates its ICs in its six-inch diameter GaAs wafer fabrication facility.
