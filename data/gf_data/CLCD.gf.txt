CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a Phase III clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing a small molecule for the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Its product candidates address the needs of migraine patients, including those with cardiovascular risk factors or stable cardiovascular disease and those dissatisfied with existing therapies. Lasmiditan, the Company's lead product candidate, is an oral tablet for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors expressed in the trigeminal pathway in the central nervous system (CNS). Lasmiditan is designed to penetrate the CNS and block the pathway that contributes to headache pain. It is developing IV lasmiditan for the acute treatment of headache pain associated with migraine in adults, to be used in emergency rooms and urgent care settings. The Company is conducting its Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of lasmiditan.
