Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno) is a biopharmaceutical company, which is focused on developing cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The Company is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. Its product candidates JCAR017, JCAR014, and JCAR015, as well as an additional early stage product candidate incorporating a fully human binding domain, leverage CAR technology to target CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of almost all B cell leukemias and lymphomas. Its CAR product candidate JCAR018 targets CD22, a different protein commonly expressed on the surface of B cell leukemias and lymphomas. Its MUC-16 directed product candidate is an armored CAR that secretes the cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12), which may help to overcome the inhibitory effects that the tumor microenvironment can have on T cell activity.
