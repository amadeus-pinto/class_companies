OCI Partners LP owns and operates an integrated methanol and ammonia production facility that is located on the Texas Gulf Coast near Beaumont. The Company has an annual methanol production capacity of approximately 912,500 metric tons and an annual ammonia production capacity of approximately 331,000 metric tons. It purchases natural gas from third parties and processes the natural gas into synthesis gas, which it then further processes in the production of methanol and ammonia. It stores and sells the processed methanol and ammonia to industrial and commercial customers for further processing or distribution. Its methanol production unit comprises Foster-Wheeler-designed twin steam methane reformers for synthesis gas production, over two Lurgi-designed parallel low-pressure, water-cooled reactors and approximately four distillation columns. The Haldor-Topsoe-designed ammonia synthesis loop at its facility processes hydrogen produced by methanol production process.
