OmniVision Technologies, Inc. (OmniVision) designs, develops, manufactures and markets image-sensor devices. The Company's primary product, a semiconductor image-sensing device called the CameraChip, is used to capture an image electronically, and is used in a range of consumer and commercial mass-market applications. Its CameraChip image sensors are manufactured using the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication process and are primarily single-chip solutions that integrate various functions, including image capture, image processing, color processing, signal conversion and output of a processed image or video stream. The Company has also integrated its CameraChip image sensors with wafer-level optics, called CameraCubeChip imaging devices. Its CameraCubeChip imaging device is a small-footprint, total camera solution. OmniVision, through Aurora Systems, Inc., offers a dual-camera video sharing technology called Video-in-Video (ViV).
