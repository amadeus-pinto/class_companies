BioTime, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases. Its clinical programs are based on two platform technologies: pluripotent stem cells and cell/drug delivery platform technologies. The foundation of its cell delivery platform is its HyStem cell and drug delivery matrix technology. Its clinical programs are targeting three primary sectors, aesthetics, ophthalmology and cell/drug delivery. Its facial aesthetics product, Renevia, is a potential treatment for facial lipoatrophy. It is in a pivotal clinical trial in Europe to assess its safety and efficacy in restoring normal skin contours in patients whose subcutaneous fat, or adipose tissue, has been lost due to the use of certain drugs often used to treat patients with human immune virus. OpRegen is its lead product for ophthalmological disorders. It is a suspension of retinal pigment epithelial cells that are derived from pluripotent stem cells.
