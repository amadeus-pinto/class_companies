Brass or glass? Grh, Inc. thinks they both slide right. The company (doing business as Latch Lake Music) makes guitar slides and microphone stands. Most of its slides are brass, but it also makes the Delta glass slide and the Bronz-O-Phonic Hawaiian steel slide. Other products are sold under the SlideRite, AcoustaGlide, and ChromeDome brand names. The micKing microphone stand is made compact enough to fit in small areas, and Xtra Boom accessories lets users add multiple mics to a single stand. Grh's Latch Lake Productions division offers booking and management services for new bands and artists.
