GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. is a molecular diagnostics company. The Company is focused on developing and commercializing multiplex molecular tests that aid in the diagnosis of complex medical conditions. It develops and commercializes multiplex molecular tests based on its eSensor electrochemical detection technology. It offers four Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostic tests which run on its XT-8 instrument; its Respiratory Viral Panel; its Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Test; its Warfarin Sensitivity Test, and its Thrombophilia Risk Test. It also offers a Hepatitis C (HCV) genotyping test and associated custom manufactured reagents, as well as a 2C19 Genotyping Test, versions of which are available for use with its XT-8 instrument for research use only (RUO). Its XT-8 and ePlex test cartridges utilize the combination of distinct electrodes and multiple signal probes to detect dozens of target biomarkers from a single sample, thereby enabling highly multiplexed testing.
