Revance Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is focused on the development, manufacturing and commercialization of botulinum toxin products for multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications. Its peptide technology enables delivery of botulinum toxin type A through two investigational drug product candidates, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002), or RT002 injectable, and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical Gel (RT001), or RT001 topical. It is engaged in the clinical development for RT002 injectable. RT002 injectable utilizes botulinum toxin-peptide complex in a saline-based formulation. In RT002 injectable, the peptide interacts with both extracellular structures and cell surface receptors in the targeted muscle. This interaction restricts the toxin molecule to the target site and reduces unwanted spread to other neighboring muscles. It is focusing on developing RT002 for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis.
