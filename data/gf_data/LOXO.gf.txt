Loxo Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on development of medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers. The Company's pipeline focuses on cancers that are dependent on single gene abnormalities, such that a single drug has the potential to treat the cancer with dramatic effect. Larotrectinib, formerly referred to as LOXO-101, is an oral, selective inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family in development for the treatment of tumors with TRK fusions. TRK fusions have been implicated in various tumor types, such as lung cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer. LOXO-195 is a drug candidate in preclinical development. It was designed as a second-generation TRK inhibitor intended to address predicted acquired resistance mechanisms resulting from therapy with a first-generation TRK inhibitor, such as larotrectinib, or multikinase inhibitors with anti-TRK activity.
