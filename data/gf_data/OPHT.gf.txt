Ophthotech Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the development of therapeutics to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on diseases of the back of the eye. Its primary focus is developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in blindness. Its product candidates include Fovista and Zimura. Fovista is designed to target platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs to disrupt the formation of abnormal new blood vessels in wet AMD. Zimura targets complement factor C5, a central component of the complement cascade. The Company has initiated a Phase II/III clinical trial investigating Zimura for treatment of geographic atrophy.
