Curis, Inc. is a biotechnology company seeking to develop and commercialize drug candidates for the treatment of cancers. The Company's drug candidate is CUDC-907, an orally-available, small molecule inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes. CUDC-907 is an oral, dual inhibitor of Class I and II HDAC, as well as Class I PI3K enzymes. CA-170 is an oral small molecule drug candidate that is designed to selectively target programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1) and V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) immune checkpoint proteins, both of which independently function as negative regulators of immune activation. CA-4948 is an oral small molecule drug candidate that is designed to inhibit the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) kinase, which is a transducer of toll-like receptor or certain interleukin receptor signaling pathways.
