RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a clinical-stage ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference (RNAi) company developing therapeutics in dermatology and ophthalmology that address unmet medical needs. The Company's development programs are based on its self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA) platform and Samcyprone, a topical immunomodulator. Its clinical development programs include RXI-109, an sd-rxRNA, for the treatment of dermal and ocular scarring, and Samcyprone for the treatment of such disorders as warts, alopecia areata, non-malignant skin tumors and cutaneous metastases of melanoma. Its pipeline is focused on approximately three areas, including dermatology, ophthalmology and cosmetic product development. Its RNAi therapies are designed to silence, or down-regulate, the expression of a specific gene that may be over-expressed in a disease condition and its immunotherapy agent treats diseases by inducing, enhancing or suppressing an immune response.
