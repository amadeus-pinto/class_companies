Vital Therapies, Inc. is a biotherapeutic company. The Company is focused on developing a human hepatic cell-based treatment targeting acute forms of liver failure. Its product candidate, the ELAD System, is an extracorporeal human allogeneic cellular liver therapy designed to allow the patient's liver to regenerate to a healthy state, or to stabilize the patient until transplant. The ELAD System is a liver support system containing immortal human liver-derived cells, or VTL C3A cells. The Company initiated a Phase III clinical trial in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis (sAAH), referred to as VTL-308. Its VTL-308 is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, pivotal study, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with sAAH. It is based on pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of its VTI-208 phase III clinical trial in alcohol-induced liver decompensation (AILD). The Company's ELAD System consists of approximately four disposable ELAD C3A cell cartridges.
