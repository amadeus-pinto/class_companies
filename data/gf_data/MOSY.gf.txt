MoSys, Inc. (MoSys), together with its subsidiaries, is a fabless semiconductor company focused on the development and sale of integrated circuits (ICs) for the high-speed networking, communications, storage and computing markets. The Company has developed approximately two IC product lines under the Bandwidth Engine and LineSpeed product names. Bandwidth Engine ICs integrate its 1T-SRAM high-density embedded memory with its integrated macro function technology and a serial interface protocol resulting in a monolithic memory IC solution optimized for transaction performance. The LineSpeed IC product line consists of non-memory, high-speed serialization-deserialization (SerDes), input/output (I/O) physical layer (PHY) devices with clock data recovery, gearbox and retimer functionality, which convert lanes of data received on line cards or by optical modules into various configurations and/or ensure signal integrity.
