AXT, Inc. (AXT) is a developer and producer of compound and single element semiconductor substrates, also known as wafers. The dominant substrates used in producing semiconductor chips and other electronic circuits are made from silicon. The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of compound semiconductor substrates and sale of materials. The Company provides alternative or specialty materials in the form of substrates or wafers, including compound and single element substrates. Its compound substrates combine indium with phosphorous (InP) or gallium with arsenic (GaAs). Its single element substrates are made from germanium (Ge). The Company uses its Vertical Gradient Freeze (VGF) technique for growing single crystal Indium Phosphide (InP), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and Germanium (Ge) ingots used to produce wafers for diverse electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit applications.
