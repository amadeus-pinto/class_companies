Cerulean Pharma Inc. is a clinical-stage, oncology-focused company. The Company applies its Dynamic Tumor Targeting platform to develop differentiated therapies. Its platform utilizes nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), which consist of polymers that are covalently linked to anti-cancer therapeutics or payloads. Its NDC platform is designed to create NDCs that accumulate high concentrations of active drug in tumor cells, without exposure to healthy tissue. Its platform is applicable to a range of payloads. It has created NDCs with a range of small molecule payloads, including Jevtana (cabazitaxel), gemcitabine, methotrexate and Xeljanz (tofacitinib). The Company's product pipeline consists of CRLX101 and CRLX301. Its CRLX101 is a tumor targeted NDC. Its CRLX301 has docetaxel as its anti-cancer payload. CRLX101 has a camptothecin payload, which is a topoisomerase 1 (topo 1) inhibitor. CRLX301 is designed to concentrate docetaxel in tumor cells and spare healthy tissue.
