Finisar Corporation (Finisar) is a provider of optical subsystems and components that are used in data communication and telecommunication applications. The Company's optical subsystems consist of transmitters, receivers, transceivers, transponders and active optical cables, which provide the fundamental optical-electrical or optoelectronic interface for interconnecting the electronic equipment used in these networks, including the switches, routers, and servers used in wireline networks. These products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuits and optoelectronic packaging to provide a means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than one gigabit per second (Gbps), to more than 100 Gbps, over distances of less than 10 meters to more than 2,000 kilometers, using a range of network protocols and physical configurations.
