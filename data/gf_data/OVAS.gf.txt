OvaScience, Inc. is a global fertility company. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of fertility treatment options for women. The Company's portfolio of fertility treatment options uses its technology, including methods to identify and isolate Egg precursor (EggPC) cells from a patient's own ovarian tissue. The Company's AUGMENT treatment is designed to improve egg health by supplementing a mitochondrial deficiency. With the AUGMENT treatment, energy-producing mitochondria from a patient's own EggPC cells are added to the patient's mature eggs during the in vitro fertilization process to supplement the existing mitochondria. Its OvaPrime treatment is a fertility treatment designed to replenish a woman's ovary by increasing her egg reserve using her own EggPC cells. Its OvaTure treatment is a fertility treatment that seeks to create mature fertilizable eggs in vitro from a woman's own EggPC cells without the need for hormone hyperstimulation.
