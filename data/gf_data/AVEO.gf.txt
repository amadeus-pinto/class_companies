AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company's platform delivers insights into cancer and related disease. The Company's product candidates include Tivozanib, Ficlatuzumab, AV-203 and AV-380. Tivozanib is a selective long half-life vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF TKI) that inhibits over three VEGF receptors. Tivozanib is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities. Ficlatuzumab is a Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) inhibitory antibody. AV-203 is an anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody with ErbB3 affinity. Its preclinical studies suggest that neuregulin1 (NRG1) levels predict AV-203 antitumor activity in preclinical models. AV-380 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) inhibitory monoclonal antibody. AV-380 targets growth differentiating factor 15 (GDF15).
