Histogenics Corporation is a regenerative medicine company. The Company is focused on developing and commercializing products in the musculoskeletal segment of the marketplace. The Company's product candidate, NeoCart utilizes various aspects of regenerative medicine platform to develop a tissue implant intended to treat tissue injury in the field of orthopedics, specifically cartilage damage in the knee. NeoCart is a cartilage-like implant created using a patient's own cartilage cells through a series of tissue engineering processes. The patient's cells are separated from a tissue biopsy specimen extracted from the patient and multiplied in its laboratory. The cells are then infused into its scaffold that provides structure for the developing implant. Before NeoCart is implanted in a patient, the cell- and scaffold construct undergoes a bioengineering process in the Company's Tissue Engineering Processor (TEP). The Company has operations in the United States and Israel.
