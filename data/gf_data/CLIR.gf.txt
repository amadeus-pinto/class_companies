ClearSign Combustion Corporation is engaged in designing and developing technologies for the purpose of managing performance characteristics of combustion systems, including emission and operational performance, and energy efficiency. The Company's Duplex and Electrodynamic Combustion Control (ECC) platform technologies manage the performance of combustion systems in a range of markets, including the energy (upstream oil production and down-stream refining), commercial/industrial boiler, chemical, petrochemical, and power industries. The Company's Duplex technology uses a porous ceramic tile above a standard burner to reduce flame length and achieve low emissions without the need for external flue gas recirculation, catalytic reduction, or air systems. The Company's ECC technology offers a computer-controlled voltage electric field into a combustion volume in order to control gas-phase chemical reactions and manage system performance.
