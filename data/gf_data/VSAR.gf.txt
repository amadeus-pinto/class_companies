Versartis, Inc. is an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing a long-acting form of recombinant human growth hormone, somavaratan (VRS-317), for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), an orphan disease. The Company's first indication for somavaratan is pediatric GHD. The Company may develop somavaratan for additional growth disorders, such as idiopathic short stature (ISS), small for gestational age (SGA) and Turner Syndrome. Somavaratan is engineered using XTEN technology to extend the residence time in the bloodstream by reducing the clearance of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) from the body by the two primary mechanisms, kidney filtration and receptor mediated clearance.
