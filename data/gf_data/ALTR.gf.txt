Altera Corporation is a semiconductor company that designs and sells a range of products, including programmable logic devices (PLDs), highly integrated power devices, pre-defined design building blocks and development software. PLDs consist of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are semiconductor integrated circuits, or chips, that the Company's customers program to perform desired logic and processing functions in their electronic systems. Highly integrated power devices, known as power system-on-chip devices (PowerSoCs), which simplify and drive the miniaturization of power circuitry found in the electronic systems of the Company's PLD customers. Pre-defined design building blocks, known as intellectual property (IP) cores, which can be licensed by customers to add standard functions to their PLD designs. Development software is used by customers to develop, compile and verify their designs, and then program their designs into the Company's PLDs.
