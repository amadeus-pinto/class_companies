Nevro Corp. is a global medical device company. The Company focuses on providing products that improve the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic pain. The Company has developed and commercialized the Senza spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, an evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. Its HF10 therapy is designed to deliver neuromodulation solutions for treating chronic pain. HF10 therapy enables patients to achieve sustained pain relief without paresthesia, thus enabling its patients to avoid the uncomfortable shocking or jolting sensations commonly associated with paresthesia. HF10 therapy relies on consistent anatomical lead placement. As of December 31, 2016, it was investigating the use of HF10 therapy to address additional indications, such as chronic upper limb and neck pain, painful neuropathies and non-surgical refractory back pain. The Senza system is approved to create electrical impulses from 2 hertz (Hz) to 10,000 Hz.
