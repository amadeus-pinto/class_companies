Advaxis, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-Listeriolysin O (LLO) cancer immunotherapies. These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Lm bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm-LLO strains integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy as they access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T-cell immunity, stimulate and activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants, and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T-cells to eliminate tumors. Axalimogene filolisbac is its lead Lm-LLO immunotherapy product candidate for the treatment of Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancers. ADXS-PSA is its Lm-LLO immunotherapy product candidate that targets the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) associated with prostate cancer.
