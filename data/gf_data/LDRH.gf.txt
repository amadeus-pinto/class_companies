LDR Holding Corporation is a medical device company. The Company focuses on designing and commercializing surgical technologies for the treatment of patients suffering from spine disorders. The Company's primary products are based on its VerteBRIDGE fusion and Mobi non-fusion platforms, both of which are designed for applications in the cervical and lumbar spine. The Company's VerteBRIDGE products are designed around its plating technology that enables surgeons to implant VerteBRIDGE devices with direct visualization of the disc and to affix the devices to the vertebrae from inside the spinal disc space. The Company's Mobi non-fusion platform is underlined by Mobi-C, a cervical disc replacement device with a mobile bearing core that is designed to replicate the natural anatomical movement of the spine by facilitating independent bending and twisting similar to a healthy disc. The Company's traditional fusion products include Easyspine, MC+, ROI, ROI-T, SpineTune and C-Plate.
