Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. is engaged in commercializing flexible photovoltaic (PV) modules using its technology. The Company's manufacturing process deposits multiple layers of materials, including a thin film of copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) semiconductor material, on a plastic substrate using a roll-to-roll manufacturing process and then laser patterns the layers to create interconnected PV cells or PV modules, in a process known as monolithic integration. The Company is producing consumer oriented products focusing on charging devices powered by its solar modules. It manufactures its products by affixing a thin CIGS layer to a flexible, plastic substrate using a roll-to-roll process. Its EnerPlex products are available on www.goenerplex.com and a range of third-party e-commerce sites, including www.amazon.com, www.bestbuy.com, www.walmart.com, www.newegg.com, www.frys.com, www.cabelas.com and several others.
