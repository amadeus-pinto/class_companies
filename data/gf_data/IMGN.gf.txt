ImmunoGen, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops targeted cancer therapeutics using its antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology. The Company is engaged in the discovery of monoclonal antibody-based anticancer therapeutics. An ADC with the Company's technology comprises an antibody that binds to a target found on tumor cells conjugated to one of its anti-cancer agents as a payload to kill the tumor cell once the ADC has bound to its target. Its product candidates include Mirvetuximab soravtansine; IMGN779; IMGN632; IMGN529, and Coltuximab ravtansine. Its portfolio is led by Mirvetuximab soravtansine, a first-in-class ADC targeting folate-receptor alpha (Fra). Its FORWARD II consists of cohorts assessing Mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with, in separate doublets, Avastin (bevacizumab), pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), and carboplatin. The Company has developed tubulin-acting maytansinoid payload agents, which include DM1 and DM4.
