Relypsa, Inc. is a United States-based biopharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of polymer-based medicines. The Company's technology platform includes a high-throughput chemistry process, enabling the Company to explore various potential polymer medicines for each disease it seeks to address. Its polymers are non-absorbed, meaning they act within the gastrointestinal tract and do not get absorbed into the bloodstream or other parts of the body. Its polymer technology may be able to address many health conditions in need of viable treatment options. Its VELTASSA (patiromer) for oral suspension is a commercialized medicine resulting from its polymer technology platform. VELTASSA is a potassium binder approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia.
