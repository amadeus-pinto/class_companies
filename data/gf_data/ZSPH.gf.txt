ZS Pharma, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of non-absorbed drugs to treat renal, cardiovascular, liver and metabolic diseases. The Company's zirconium silicate technology allows it to create selective ion traps that can reduce toxic levels of specific electrolytes without disturbing the balance of other electrolytes. The Company has completed Phase III development of its product candidate, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a life-threatening condition in which elevated levels of potassium increase the risk of muscle dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The Company has completed three clinical studies with ZS-9 for patients with hyperkalemia, including patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), diabetes and those on renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy.
