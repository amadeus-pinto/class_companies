EnteroMedics Inc. (EnteroMedics) is a medical device company. The Company is focused on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity, metabolic diseases and other gastrointestinal disorders. The Company's neuroblocking technology, which is referred to as VBLOC therapy, is designed to intermittently block the vagus nerve. The Company's initial product is the Maestro Rechargeable System, which uses VBLOC therapy to limit the expansion of the stomach, help control hunger sensations between meals, reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness. The Company's VBLOC therapy is designed to block the gastrointestinal effects of the vagus nerve by replicating a vagotomy using high-frequency, low-energy electrical impulses to intermittently interrupt naturally occurring neural impulses on the vagus nerve between the brain and the digestive system.
