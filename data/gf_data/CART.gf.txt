People can get a variety of food items by ordering ï¿½ la carte, and mobile food vendors can get a variety of vehicles and equipment from All A Cart Manufacturing. Since 1972, the company has been building and modifying carts, kiosks, step vans, vending tricycles, and trailers to be used for food preparation and sales. All A Cart offers products designed to handle hot food, beverages, and ice cream. Customers who can't find what they want on the company's menu of options can order custom jobs. Not satisfied with just building and modifying food-related vehicles, the company's All Car Excellence division restores classic cars and sells vintage replacement parts.
