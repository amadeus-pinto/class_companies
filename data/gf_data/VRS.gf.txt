Verisante Technology, Inc. is a medical device company focusing on commercializing systems for the early detection of cancer. The Company's device, called the Verisante Aura can be used in the early detection of all forms of skin cancer, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. The Verisante Core device is based on the same platform technology as the Aura and can be used in the early detection of lung, cervical, gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers. Verisante Aura is a spectroscopy system designed to aid in the detection of skin cancer. This system provides information about the chemical composition of the skin non-invasively. Aura scans for different spectral markers. Verisante Core uses an endoscopic attachment to aid in the detection of lung, colon, cervical, and other cancers. It has completed a second Phase prototype of a rapid Multispectral Imaging camera (MSI) system for skin cancer detection.
