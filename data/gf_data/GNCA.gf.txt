Genocea Biosciences, Inc., is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop vaccines and immunotherapies company. The Company uses its discovery platform, AnTigen Lead Acquisition System (ATLAS), to design vaccines and immunotherapies that act, in part, through T cell (or cellular) immune responses. The Company has one product candidate in Phase III clinical development, GEN-003, an immunotherapy for the treatment of genital herpes. It also has a pre-clinical immuno-oncology program focused on personalized cancer vaccines (GEN-009). The GEN-009 program leverages ATLAS to identify patient neoantigens, or newly formed antigens unique to each patient, that are associated with that individual's tumor.
