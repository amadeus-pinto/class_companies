Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. is an in vitro diagnostics company engaged in providing solutions that develop patient outcomes through the diagnosis of serious infections. The Company's in vitro diagnostic platform, the Accelerate Pheno system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID), infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which determines whether live bacterial or fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antibiotic. It detects and identifies pathogens directly from a single patient sample followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on the identification results. The Accelerate PhenoTest BC Kit provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. The Accelerate Pheno system features walk-away automation and consists of a fixed instrument and single-use test kit.
