IXYS Corporation (IXYS) is a multi-market integrated semiconductor company. The Company is engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of power semiconductors, mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), microcontrollers, systems and radio frequency (RF) power semiconductors. Its power semiconductors are sold separately and are also packaged in high power modules that consist of multiple semiconductor dies. Its power metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) transistors operate at greater switching speeds than bipolar transistors. Its ICs address the demand for analog, mixed-signal and digital interface solutions in communication and other industries and include microcontrollers, mixed-signal application-specific ICs. RF power devices switch electricity at the high rates necessary to enable the amplification or reception of radio frequencies. It manufactures and sells laser diode drivers, high voltage pulse generators and modulators.
