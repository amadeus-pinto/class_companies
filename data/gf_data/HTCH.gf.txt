Hutchinson Technology Incorporated is a global supplier of critical precision component technologies. The Company is engaged in manufacturing suspension assemblies for all sizes and types of hard disk drives. Suspension assemblies are components of disk drives that hold the read/write heads in position above the spinning magnetic disks. It manufactures its suspension assemblies with technology and processes with low part-to-part variation. The Company categorizes its products as either suspension assemblies or other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue outside of the disk drive industry for precision component manufacturing, tool design, tool build and metrology, suspension assembly components, reimbursement for disk drive industry-related engineering services and specific disk drive program capacity, and biomeasurement products. It sells its suspension assemblies to original equipment manufacturers.
