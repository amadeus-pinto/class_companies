Entegris, Inc. develops, manufactures and supplies materials and solutions for advanced manufacturing processes in the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. The company&#x27;s products include both unit driven and capital expense driven products. Its unit-driven and consumable product class includes membrane-based liquid filters and housings, metal-based gas filters, resin-based gas purifiers, wafer shippers, disk-shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components used in plasma etch, ion implant and chemical vapor deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Its capital expense-driven products include components, systems and subsystems that use electro-mechanical, pressure differential and related technologies, to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes, and process carriers that protect the integrity of in-process wafers. The company operates through the following business segments: critical materials handling and electronic materials. The critical materials handling segment offers products that purify, monitor and deliver critical liquids and gases to the semiconductor manufacturing process and similar manufacturing processes as well as microenvironments products to preserve the integrity of wafers, reticles and electronic components at various stages of transport, processing and storage and materials, components and services to a wide range of customers in the semiconductor industry and in adjacent and unrelated industries. The electronic materials segment offers materials and materials delivery systems to support the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. Entegris was founded in March 2005 and is headquartered in Billerica, MA.
