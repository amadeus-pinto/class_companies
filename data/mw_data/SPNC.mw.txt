The Spectranetics Corp. is a medical device company that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. Its products are used to treat arterial blockages in the heart and legs as well as the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads. It has two reportable segments, which were identified on a geographic basis: U.S.Medical and International Medical. These segments offer the same products and services but operate in different geographic regions, with different distribution networks and different regulatory environments. Within U.S. Medical, the company aggregates its two business units, Vascular Intervention and Lead Management. The Vascular Intervention business line manufactures and sells a range of peripheral and cardiac laser catheters for ablation of stenosed and occluded arteries above and below the knee and within coronary arteries. The Lead Management business line includes the manufacturing of excimer laser sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories, including lead locking stylets for manual traction and aid in laser-assisted extraction of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator leads. The company was founded by Robert Golobic, Johan Sverdrup and Richard T. Simko in 1984 and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO.
