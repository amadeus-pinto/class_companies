Accuray, Inc. is the premier radiation oncology company which develops, manufactures and sells personalized treatment solutions such as the cyberKnife and tomotherapy systems, which are designed to deliver radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy and adaptive radiation therapy. The cyberKnife system is designed to combine continual image guidance technology with a compact linear accelerator, or linac, which has the ability to move in three dimensions according to the treatment plan. The tomotherapy system operates on a ring gantry and combines integrated computed tomography, or CT, imaging with intensity modulated radiation therapy, which is designed to deliver radiation treatments with speed and precision while reducing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.
