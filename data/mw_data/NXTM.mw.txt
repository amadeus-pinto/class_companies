NxStage Medical, Inc. operates as a medical device company which manufactures and markets products for the treatment of kidney failure, fluid overload and related blood treatments and procedures. Its primary product, the NxStage System One, was designed to satisfy an unmet clinical need for a system that can deliver the therapeutic flexibility and clinical benefits associated with traditional dialysis machines in a smaller, portable, easy to use form that can be used by healthcare professionals and trained lay users alike in a variety of settings, including patient homes, as well as more traditional care settings such as hospitals and dialysis clinics. The company also markets its product NxStage System One to hospitals for treatment of acute kidney failure and fluid overload. The company operates through the following segments: System One, In-Center and Services. The System One segment engages in the sale and rental of the System One and PureFlow SL equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets. The In-Center segment sells blood tubing sets and needles for hemodialysis primarily for the treatment of ESRD patients at dialysis centers and needles for apheresis. The Services segment includes revenues from dialysis services provided to patients at its recently opened NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers. NxStage Medical was founded by Jeffrey H. Burbank in December 1998 and is headquartered in Lawrence, MA.
