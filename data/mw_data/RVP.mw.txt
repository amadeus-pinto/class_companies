Retractable Technologies, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets safety needle devices for the healthcare industry. The company&#x27;s VanishPoint products utilize a patented friction ring mechanism. The friction ring mechanism permits the automated retraction of the needle into the barrel of the syringe, directly from the patient, after delivery of the medication is completed. VanishPoint products are designed specifically to prevent needlestick injuries and to prevent reuse. The VanishPoint blood collection tube holder utilizes the same mechanism to retract the needle after blood has been drawn from the patient. Retractable Technologies was founded by Thomas J. Shaw on May 9, 1994 and is headquartered in Little Elm, TX.
