	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
	This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements.
	In addition to factors previously identified elsewhere in the reports and other documents TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance:
	an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies&#8217; abilities to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in those portfolio companies;
	such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies in which we have invested and others that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies;
	such an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing;
	an inability to access the capital markets could impair our ability to raise capital and our investment activities; and
	the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this report and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC.
	Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. The safe harbor provisions of Section&#160;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company.

	ITEM&#160;1. BUSINESS
	General
	Our Company
	We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2016, we have originated more than $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities. By &#8220;middle-market companies,&#8221; we mean companies that have annual earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2016, our core portfolio companies, which exclude certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 88.2% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $144.1 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $31.4 million.
	We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees.
	We have operated as a business development company, or a BDC, since we began our investment activities in July 2011, and we are currently one of the largest publicly listed BDCs by total assets. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of our Adviser and its affiliates.
	The companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). We invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; &#8220;last out&#8221; first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior &#8220;first out&#8221; first-lien loans; &#8220;unitranche&#8221; loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt. As of December&#160;31, 2016, based on fair value our portfolio consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 1.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.6% mezzanine and unsecured debt investments, and 1.7% equity and other investments. Approximately 98.4% of our debt investments based on fair value as of December&#160;31, 2016 bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 94.8% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation. As of December&#160;31, 2016 we had investments in 52 portfolio companies. As of December&#160;31, 2016, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $31.9 million based on fair value. As of December 31, 2016, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 4.5% of our total investment portfolio.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, our portfolio was invested across 19 different industries. The largest industries in our portfolio as of December 31, 2016 were business services and healthcare, which represented, as a percentage of our portfolio, 22.6%, and 12.2%, respectively, based on fair value.
	We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. Because we elected to be a BDC and have elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. tax purposes, our portfolio is and will continue to be subject to diversification and other requirements to maintain such status elections.
	We borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act to fund investments and for general corporate purposes. Under the 1940 Act, we can incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock is at least 200%. In determining whether to borrow money, we analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, as well as the risks of those borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds
	4
	of preferred stock offerings to make investments has its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock are borne by us,
	and ultimately the holders of our common stock. See &#8220;
	ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
	Risks Related to Our Business and Structure&#8212;We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and increases the risk of investing in us.&#8221;
	Our operations comprise only a single reportable segment.
	Relationship with our Adviser, TSSP and TPG
	Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator, and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through our Investment Team, a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser&#8217;s Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly, our Co-Chief Executive Officer Michael Fishman and our Adviser&#8217;s Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, all of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and TPG Special Situations Partners, LLC, or &#8220;TSSP&#8221;.
	TSSP, with over $18 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2016, is TPG&#8217;s special situations and credit platform and encompasses TPG Specialty Lending, TPG Opportunities Partners and TSSP Adjacent Opportunities Partners, which invest in special situations and distressed investments across the credit cycle, TSL Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations, and TPG Institutional Credit Partners, which is a &#8220;public-side&#8221; credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets. TSSP has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 160 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2016, twenty nine (29) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty one (21) investment professionals.
	TPG is a leading global private investment firm founded in 1992 with $74 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2016, and offices in San Francisco, Fort Worth, New York and throughout the world.&#160;In addition to TSSP, TPG&#8217;s investment business includes discrete investment platforms focused on a range of alternative investment products, including TPG Capital, which is TPG&#8217;s flagship large capitalization private equity business and focuses on global investments across all major industry sectors; TPG Growth, which invests in small- and middle-market growth equity and corporate opportunities in all major industry sectors in North America and in other developed and emerging markets; TPG Biotechnology Partners, which invests in early- and late-stage venture capital opportunities in the biotechnology and related life sciences industries; and TPG Real Estate, which is the real estate platform of TPG. TPG has extensive experience with global public and private investments executed through leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, spinouts, growth investments, joint ventures and restructurings, and has a team of over 300 professionals.&#160;
	Our Adviser consults with TSSP and TPG in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The TSSP and TPG platforms provide us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from their market expertise, insights into sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. TSSP and TPG will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us by TSSP and TPG.
	On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested.
	We believe our ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates we will continue to be able to provide &#8220;one-stop&#8221; financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors. See
	"Regulation as a Business Development - Company Transactions with our affiliates.&#8221;
	The Adviser is responsible for managing our day-to-day business affairs, including implementing investment policies and strategic initiatives set by our Investment Team and managing our portfolio under the general oversight of our Investment Review Committee.
	5
	On April&#160;15, 2011, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement
	was subsequently amended on December&#160;12, 2011. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to us.
	The Adviser&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee. For a discussion of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee payable by us to the Adviser, see &#8220;
	Management Agreements&#8212;Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement
	.&#8221; Our Board monitors the mix and performance of our investments over time and seeks to satisfy itself that the Adviser is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Adviser to do so.
	In November 2016, our Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2017, and may be extended subject to required approvals.
	Investment Criteria/Guidelines
	Investment Decision Process
	Our investment approach involves, among other things:
	an assessment of the markets, overall macroeconomic environment and how the assessment may impact industry and investment selection;
	substantial company-specific research and analysis; and
	with respect to each individual company, an emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility and management of downside risk.
	The foundation of our investment philosophy incorporates intensive analysis, a management discipline based on both market technicals and fundamental value-oriented research, and consideration of diversification within our portfolio. We follow a rigorous investment process based on:
	a comprehensive analysis of issuer creditworthiness, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the issuer&#8217;s business;
	an evaluation of management and its economic incentives;
	an analysis of business strategy and industry trends; and
	an in-depth examination of a prospective portfolio company&#8217;s capital structure, financial results and projections.
	We seek to identify those companies exhibiting superior fundamental risk-reward profiles and strong defensible business franchises, while focusing on the absolute and relative value of the investment.
	Investment Process Overview
	Origination and Sourcing
	The substantial majority of our investments are not intermediated and are originated without the assistance of investment banks or other traditional Wall Street sources. In addition to executing direct calling campaigns on companies based on the Adviser&#8217;s sector and macroeconomic views, our Investment Team also maintains direct contact with financial sponsors, banks, corporate advisory firms, industry consultants, attorneys, investment banks, &#8220;club&#8221; investors and other potential sources of lending opportunities. The substantial majority of our deals are informed by our current sector views and are sourced directly by our Adviser through our network contacts. We also identify opportunities through our Adviser&#8217;s relationships with TSSP and TPG.
	6
	Due Diligence Process
	The process through which an investment decision is made involves extensive research into the company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If the investment team responsible for the transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, we will engage in an intensive due diligence process. Though each transaction will involve a somewhat different approach, our diligence of each opportunity may include:
	understanding the purpose of the capital requirement, the key personnel and variables, as well as the sources and uses of the proceeds;
	meeting the company&#8217;s management, including top and middle-level executives, to get an insider&#8217;s view of the business, and to probe for potential weaknesses in business prospects;
	checking management&#8217;s backgrounds and references;
	performing a detailed review of historical financial performance, including performance through various economic cycles, and the quality of earnings;
	contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and standard practices;
	conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the company to its main competitors on an operating, financial, market share and valuation basis;
	researching the industry for historic growth trends and future prospects as well as to identify future exit alternatives;
	assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth;
	leveraging TSSP and TPG internal resources with institutional knowledge of the company&#8217;s business; and
	investigating legal and regulatory risks and financial and accounting systems and practices.
	Selective Investment Process
	After an investment has been identified and preliminary diligence has been completed, a credit research and analysis report is prepared. This report is reviewed by senior investment professionals. If these senior and other investment professionals are supportive of pursuing the potential investment, then a more extensive due diligence process is employed. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys, independent accountants, and other third-party consultants and research firms prior to the closing of the investment, as appropriate, on a case-by-case basis.
	Issuance of Formal Commitment
	Approval of an investment requires the approval of the Investment Review Committee or, depending on the size and nature of the investment, a portion thereof. Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management or sponsor of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, if any, to finalize the structure and terms of the investment.
	Portfolio Monitoring
	The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company.
	The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:
	assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;
	periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
	comparisons to other companies in the industry;
	attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and
	review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
	7
	As part of the monitoring process, the Advis
	er regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by
	our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:
	An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company&#8217;s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews.
	An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company&#8217;s operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company.
	An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its &#8220;watch list&#8221; and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company.
	An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments. For these investments, the Adviser prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees.
	A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investment on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout.
	For more information on the investment performance ratings of our portfolio, see
	Investment Review Committee
	The Adviser manages our portfolio under the general oversight of the Investment Review Committee. The Investment Review Committee includes certain individuals who are senior personnel of the Adviser and TSSP, as well as certain other persons appointed by the Adviser from time to time. Our Investment Team and the Investment Review Committee are supported by and have access to the investment professionals, analytical capabilities and support personnel of TSSP and TPG.
	Structure of Investments
	Since beginning our investment activities in July 2011, we have sought to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity and other investments.
	Debt Investments
	The terms of our debt investments are tailored to the facts and circumstances of each transaction and prospective portfolio company. We negotiate the structure of each investment to protect our rights and manage our risk while providing funding to help the portfolio company achieve its business plan. We invest in the following types of debt:
	First-lien debt.
	First-lien debt is typically senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer&#8217;s capital structure and has the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans, &#8220;last out&#8221; first-lien loans, &#8220;unitranche&#8221; loans and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans.
	Stand-alone first-lien loans.
	Stand-alone first-lien loans are traditional first-lien loans. All lenders in the facility have equal rights to the collateral that is subject to the first-priority security interest.
	8
	single lien on the collateral. Since the &#8220;first out&#8221; lenders generally have priority over the
	receive a higher effective interest rate, through arrangements among the lenders, than the &#8220;first out&#8221; lenders or lenders in stand-alone first-lien loans. Agreements among lenders also typically provide greater voting rights to the &#8220;last out&#8221; lenders than
	the intercreditor agreements to which second-lien lenders often are subject.
	Unitranche loans combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position. In many cases, we may provide the borrower most, if not all, of the capital structure above the equity. The primary advantages to the borrower are the ability to negotiate the entire debt financing with one lender and the elimination of intercreditor issues.
	Second-lien debt.
	Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt. Second-lien debt typically is senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer&#8217;s capital structure and has the benefit of a security interest over assets of the issuer, though ranking junior to first-lien debt secured by those assets. First-lien lenders and second-lien lenders typically have separate liens on the collateral, and an intercreditor agreement provides the first-lien lenders with priority over the second-lien lenders&#8217; liens on the collateral.
	Structurally, mezzanine&#160;debt usually ranks subordinate in priority of payment to first-lien and second-lien debt and may not have the benefit of financial covenants common in first-lien and second-lien debt. Unsecured debt may rank junior as it relates to proceeds in certain liquidations where it does not have the benefit of a lien in specific collateral held by creditors (typically first lien and/or second lien) who have a perfected security interest in such collateral. However,&#160;both&#160;mezzanine and unsecured debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in an issuer&#8217;s capital structure. Mezzanine and unsecured debt investments generally offer lenders fixed returns in the form of interest payments and mezzanine debt will often provide lenders an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation, if any, of an issuer through an equity interest. This equity interest typically takes the form of an equity co-investment or warrants. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants compared to senior secured loans, mezzanine and unsecured debt generally bears a higher stated interest rate than first-lien and second-lien debt.
	Our debt investments are typically structured with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target. We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
	requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; and
	negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative covenants (including reporting requirements), negative covenants (including financial covenants), lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board under some circumstances.
	Among the types of first-lien debt in which we invest, we generally are able to obtain higher effective interest rates on our &#8220;last out&#8221; first-lien loans than on other types of first-lien loans, since our &#8220;last-out&#8221; first-lien loans generally are more junior in the capital structure. Within our portfolio, we aim to maintain the appropriate proportion among the various types of first-lien loans, as well as second-lien debt and mezzanine debt, which allows us to achieve our target returns while maintaining our targeted amount of credit risk.
	Equity and Other Investments
	Our loans may include an equity interest in the issuer, such as a warrant or profit participation right. In certain instances, we also will make direct equity investments, although those situations are generally limited to those cases where we are making an investment in a more senior part of the capital structure of the issuer.
	Investments
	As of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, we had made investments with an aggregate fair value of $1,657.4 million and $1,485.7 million, respectively, in 52 and 46 portfolio companies, respectively.

	As of December 31, 2016, we had additional unfunded commitments of $50.0 million to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of December 31, 2015.
	From time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. As of December 31, 2016, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.
	Competition
	We compete for investments with a number of BDCs and other investment funds (including private equity funds and venture capital funds), special purpose acquisition company sponsors, investment banks with underwriting activities, hedge funds that invest in private investments in public equities, traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks, and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. For additional information concerning the
	11
	competitive risks we expect to face, see &#8220;
	ITEM 1A. RISK
	FACTORS&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure&#8212;We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
	Capital Resources and Borrowings
	We anticipate generating cash in the future from issuances of common stock and cash flows from operations, including interest received on our cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
	Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. As of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, our asset coverage was 237.7% and 225.7%, respectively. See &#8220;
	Regulation as a Business Development Company&#8212;Senior Securities
	Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders (which may cause us to fail to distribute amounts necessary to avoid entity-level taxation under the Code), or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In addition, we must also comply with positive and negative covenants customary for these types of facilities.

	Dividend Policy
	To maintain our status as a RIC, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes of an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest, the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as well as other taxable income, excluding any net capital gains reduced by deductible expenses) and 90% of our net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to stockholders. In addition, to avoid the imposition of a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:
	98% of our net ordinary income, excluding certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized during a calendar year;
	98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October&#160;31 of such calendar year; and
	100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.
	We have previously incurred, and can be expected to incur in the future, such excise tax on a portion of our income and gains. While we intend to distribute income and capital gains to minimize exposure to the 4% excise tax, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
	See &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure&#8212;We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.&#8221;
	Dividend Reinvestment Plan
	We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends or distributions declared by the Board on behalf of investors who do not elect to receive their cash dividends or distributions in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, then our stockholders who have not elected to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional common stock as described below.
	No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have its cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in our common stock. A registered stockholder is able to elect to receive an entire cash dividend or distribution in cash by notifying State Street Bank and Trust Company, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing, so that notice is received by the plan administrator no later than 10&#160;days prior to the record date for the cash dividend or distributions to the stockholders. The plan administrator has set up an account for&#160;shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive cash dividends or distributions in cash and hold the&#160;shares in non-certificated form.
	Those stockholders whose&#160;shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive cash dividends and other distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
	We expect to use primarily newly issued&#160;shares to implement the plan, whether our&#160;shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. We reserve the right to purchase&#160;shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. The number of&#160;shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or &#8220;NYSE,&#8221; on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, we will issue&#160;shares at the greater of (i)&#160;the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii)&#160;95% of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). Shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator will be allocated to a stockholder based on the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all&#160;shares of common stock purchased in the open market.
	The number of&#160;shares of our common stock that will be outstanding after giving effect to payment of a cash dividend or distribution cannot be established until the value per share at which additional&#160;shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our stockholders have been tabulated. The number of&#160;shares to be issued to a stockholder pursuant to the foregoing will be rounded down to the nearest whole share to avoid the issuance of fractional&#160;shares, with any fractional&#160;shares being paid in cash. For non-U.S. stockholders, the number of&#160;shares to be issued to the stockholder will be the amount equal to the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable, net of applicable withholding taxes.
	13
	There are no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan is terminable by us upon notice in writing mailed to each stockholder of record at least 30&#160;days prior to any record date for the
	payment of any cash dividend or distribution by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the&#160;shares held by the plan administrator in the participant&#8217;s account and remit the
	proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a brokerage commission from the proceeds.
	Administration
	Each of our executive officers is an employee of our Adviser or its affiliates. We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Individuals who are employees of our Adviser or its affiliates provide services necessary for our business under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Adviser and the services necessary for the origination and administration of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by our Adviser or its affiliates. Our Investment Team focuses on origination and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments. In addition, we reimburse the Adviser for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). See &#8220;
	Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement
	Management Agreements
	Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement
	On April&#160;15, 2011, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement was subsequently amended on December&#160;12, 2011.
	Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser:
	determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing those changes;
	identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);
	determines the assets we will originate, purchase, retain or sell;
	closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any rights in our capacity as a lender or equity holder; and
	provides us other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds, including providing operating and managerial assistance to us and our portfolio companies, as required.
	The Adviser&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to us are not impaired.
	Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser a base management fee, or the &#8220;Management Fee,&#8221; and may also pay certain incentive fees, or &#8220;Incentive Fees&#8221;.
	The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% based on the average value of our gross assets calculated using the values at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is prorated for any partial month or quarter.
	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Management Fees were $24.3 million and $21.3 million, respectively, of which $0.1 million and $0.1 million were waived (see below).
	Prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, in March 2014, the Adviser had waived its right to receive the Management Fee in excess of the sum of (i)&#160;0.25% of aggregate committed but undrawn capital and (ii)&#160;0.75% of aggregate drawn capital (including capital drawn to pay our expenses) as determined as of the end of any calendar quarter (the &#8220;Pre-IPO Waiver&#8221;).
	In addition, the Adviser has voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of shares of common stock in TICC Capital Corp. (the &#8220;TICC Shares&#8221;) for any period in which TICC Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company.

	For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, Management Fees of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were waived, consisting solely
	of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. For the year ended December 31, 2014 Management Fees of $2.5 million were waived pursuant to the Pre-IPO Waiver. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
	The Incentive Fee consists of two parts, as follows:
	(i)
	Through March 31, 2014, the quarter in which we completed our IPO, the first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equaled 100% of the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a 1.5% quarterly &#8220;hurdle rate,&#8221; the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser had received 15% of the total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and, for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.76% quarterly, 15% of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The 100% &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the 1.5% &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 15% on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals 1.76% in a quarter (7.04% annualized), which was the rate at which catch-up was achieved. Once the &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; was reached and catch-up was achieved, 15% of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.76% in any quarter was payable to the Adviser.
	Beginning April 1, 2014, the first quarter after our IPO, the first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equals 100% of the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a 1.5% quarterly &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221;, the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser has received 17.5% of the total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and, for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% quarterly, 17.5% of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The 100% &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the 1.5% &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals 1.82% in a quarter (7.28% annualized), which is the rate at which catch-up is achieved. Once the &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is reached and catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% in any quarter is payable to the Adviser.
	Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income means dividends, interest and fee income accrued by us during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to the Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we may not have received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
	(ii)
	The second component, payable at the end of each fiscal year in arrears, equaled 15% through March 31, 2014, and beginning April 1, 2014, equals a weighted percentage of cumulative realized capital gains from our inception to the end of that fiscal year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. We refer to this component of the Incentive Fee as the Capital Gains Fee. Each year, the fee paid for this component of the Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee for prior periods. For capital gains that accrue following March 31, 2014, the Incentive Fee rate is 17.5%. We accrue, but do not pay, a Capital Gains Incentive Fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a Capital Gains Incentive Fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. The weighted percentage is intended to ensure that for each fiscal year following the completion of the IPO, the portion of our realized capital gains that accrued prior to March 31, 2014 is subject to an Incentive Fee rate of 15% and the portion of our realized capital gains that accrued beginning April 1, 2014 is subject to an Incentive Fee rate of 17.5%.
	To determine whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, prior to the IPO, the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income was expressed as a rate of return on an average daily hurdle calculation value. The average daily hurdle calculation value, on any given day, equaled:
	our net assets as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the day; plus
	the aggregate amount of capital drawn from investors (or reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan) from the beginning of the current quarter to the day; minus
	the aggregate amount of distributions (including share repurchases) made by us from the beginning of the current quarter to the day (but only to the extent the distributions were not declared and accounted for on our books and records in a previous quarter).
	For purposes of determining whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-Incentive Fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	15
	Pre-Incentive Fee net inves
	tment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the Incentive Fee, it is possible that we may pay an Incentive Fee in a quarter in which we in
	cur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable Incentive Fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital l
	osses. In addition, because the quarterly minimum hurdle rate is calculated based on our net assets, decreases in our net assets due to realized or unrealized capital losses in any given quarter may increase the likelihood that the hurdle rate is reached a
	nd therefore the likelihood of us paying an Incentive Fee for that quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the Management Fee because gros
	s assets are total assets (including cash received) before deducting liabilities (such as declared dividend payments).
	We accrue the Incentive Fee taking into account unrealized gains and losses; however, Section&#160;205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act, as amended, prohibits the Adviser from receiving the payment of fees until those gains are realized, if ever. There can be no assurance that such unrealized gains will be realized in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Incentive Fees were $22.7 million and $20.2 million, respectively, comprised of fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no incentive fees were accrued related to capital gains.
	The Adviser has voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TICC Shares for any period in which TICC Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Capital Gains Fee attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the TICC Shares will be applied against our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Capital Gains Fee is calculated.
	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Incentive Fees of $0.3 million and $0.2 million were waived, respectively, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. Any waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
	Following the IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees and certain Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive any Management Fees or Incentive Fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will continue to waive Management Fees or Incentive Fees related to our ownership of the TICC Shares, as the Adviser can discontinue the voluntary waiver at any time. Accordingly, we may be required to continue to pay the full amount of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee, including with respect to the TICC Shares, in future periods.
	In November 2016, the Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2017, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party.
	The December&#160;12, 2011 amendment to the Investment Advisory Agreement revised the base against which the 1.5% hurdle rate is measured when calculating the Adviser&#8217;s entitlement to receive a portion of our pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in any given calendar quarter. The amendment applied retroactively to October&#160;1, 2011. Since the completion of our IPO, the base against which the hurdle rate is calculated is determined as described above in this section.
	Our Board monitors the mix and performance of our investments over time and seeks to satisfy itself that the Adviser is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Adviser to do so.
	On March&#160;15, 2011, we entered into the Administration Agreement with our Adviser. The Administration Agreement was subsequently amended on February 22, 2017 to make certain clarifications to the agreement, including with respect to the scope of the costs and expenses of the Administrator&#8217;s services. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. See &#8220;&#8212;
	Payment of Our Expenses
	From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by us to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and we will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on our behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms.
	16
	In February 2017, the Board approved an amendment to the Administration Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as
	described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until February&#160;2018, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days&#8217; written notice to the ot
	her party.
	No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as our director receives any compensation from us for his or her services as a director. However, we reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Directors who are not affiliated with the Adviser receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings.
	The Adviser does not assume any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in, and on the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, and is not responsible for any action of our Board in declining to follow the advice or recommendations of the Adviser. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, the Adviser (and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it) shall not be liable to us for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of ours (except to the extent specified in Section&#160;36(b) of the 1940 Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services). We shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide indemnification and the right to the advancement of expenses, to each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a member, manager, officer, employee, agent, controlling person of the Adviser or any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, or is or was a member of the Adviser&#8217;s Investment Review Committee, on the same general terms set forth in Article VIII of our certificate of incorporation.
	United States federal and state securities laws may impose liability under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith. Nothing in the Investment Advisory Agreement will constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights that we may have under any applicable federal or state securities laws.
	We also have a license agreement with an affiliate of TPG, pursuant to which we have been granted a non-exclusive license to use the TPG name and logo, for a nominal fee, for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the &#8220;TPG&#8221; name or logo.

	Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income
	(investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.425%
	Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no Incentive Fee.

	Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income
	(investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.8%
	Incentive Fee = 100% &#215; pre-Incentive Fee net investment income, subject to the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; (4)
	= 100% &#215; (1.8% &#8211; 1.5%)

	Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
	Hurdle rate (1)&#160;= 1.5%
	Management fee (2)&#160;= 0.375%
	Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3)&#160;= 0.20%
	Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income
	(investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.925%
	Incentive Fee = 17.5% &#215; pre-Incentive Fee net investment income, subject to &#8220;catch-up&#8221; (4)
	Incentive Fee = 100% &#215; &#8220;catch-up&#8221; + (17.5% &#215; (pre-Incentive Fee net investment income &#8211; 1.82%))
	Catch-up = 1.82% &#8211; 1.5% = 0.32%
	Incentive Fee = (100% &#215; 0.32%) + (17.5% &#215; (2.925% &#8211; 1.82%))
	= 0.32% + (17.5% &#215; 1.105%)
	= 0.32% + 0.193%
	= 0.513%
	(1)
	Represents 6.0% annualized hurdle rate.
	(2)
	Represents 1.5% annualized management fee. For the purposes of these examples the management fee is assumed to be based on net assets, rather than gross assets.
	(3)
	Excludes organizational and offering expenses.
	(4)
	The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of 17.5% on all of our pre-Incentive Fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 1.5% in any calendar quarter and is not applied once the Adviser has received 17.5% of investment income in a quarter. The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; portion of our pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is the portion that exceeds the 1.5% hurdle rate but is less than or equal to approximately 1.82% (that is, 1.5% divided by (1 &#8211; 0.175)) in any fiscal quarter.

	Indemnification
	The Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement provide that the Adviser and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it shall not be liable to us for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of ours (except to the extent specified in Section&#160;36(b) of the 1940 Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services). We will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide indemnification and the right to the advancement of expenses, to each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, because he or she is or was a member, manager, officer, employee, agent, controlling person or any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation the Administrator, or is or was a member of the Adviser&#8217;s Investment Review Committee, on the same general terms set forth in our certificate of incorporation. Our obligation to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses is subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No.&#160;11330, which, among other things, preclude indemnification for any liability (whether or not there is an adjudication of liability or the matter has been settled) arising by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, and require reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification will be made.

	Our Board, including our Independent Directors, and holders of a majority of our outstanding securities, approved our Investment Advisory Agreement in December 2011. Our Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement in November 2016. In its consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement at the time of approval and renewal, the Board focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:
	the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by the Adviser;
	our investment performance and the performance of the Adviser;
	the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as we grow, and whether the fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our stockholders;
	comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives;
	our expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives;
	any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those income sources;
	information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing those services under the Investment Advisory Agreement;
	the organizational capability and financial condition of the Adviser and its respective affiliates; and
	the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers or through an internally managed structure.
	The Board also takes into consideration the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Adviser on our behalf, which expenses include travel expenses, when determining whether to approve renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. No one factor was given greater weight than any others, but rather the Board considered all factors collectively as a whole.
	Based on the information reviewed and the discussion thereof, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided.

	Regulation as a Business Development Company
	We are regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses.
	As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office.
	As a BDC, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after any borrowing or issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratio at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;
	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure&#8212;We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and increases the risk of investing in us
	.&#8221; As of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, our asset coverage was 237.7% and 225.7% respectively.
	We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a)&#160;67% or more of such company&#8217;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, and (b)&#160;more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company.
	We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
	We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our status as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See &#8220;&#8212;Regulated Investment Company Classification&#8221; for more information.
	In addition, investment companies registered under the 1940 Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; pursuant to either Section&#160;3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the 1940 Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions.
	We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See &#8220;
	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure&#8212;Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.
	We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
	As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See &#8220;
	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure.
	23
	Transactions with our Affiliates
	We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates, including our officers, directors, investment adviser, and principal underwriters, and certain of their affiliates, without the prior approval of the members of our Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC through an exemptive order (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance).
	On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate for us to invest, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested.
	We believe our ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates we will continue to be able to provide &#8220;one-stop&#8221; financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.
	Further, in accordance with the exemptive order, we have undertaken that, in connection with any commitment to a co-investment or follow-on investment, a &#8220;required majority&#8221; (as defined in Section&#160;57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Independent Directors must make certain conclusions, including that:
	the terms of the proposed transaction (including the consideration to be paid) are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned;
	the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and our investment strategies and policies;
	the investment by our affiliate would not disadvantage us, and our participation is not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of our affiliate; and
	our investment will not benefit any affiliate other than the affiliate participating in the investment, and as otherwise permitted by the order.
	See &#8220;
	ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.
	Qualifying Assets
	Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any assets other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:
	Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
	is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
	is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by us) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
	satisfies any of the following:
	has an equity market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;
	is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
	is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
	Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
	24
	Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investmen
	t company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations
	as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
	Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
	Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
	Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
	Pending investment in other types of &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, such that at least 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
	Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
	A BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described under &#8220;Qualifying Assets&#8221; above. However, to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, either controlling the issuer of the securities or any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does in fact provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
	Senior Securities
	As a BDC, we generally must have 200% asset coverage for our debt after incurring any new indebtedness, meaning that the total value of our assets must be at least twice the amount of the debt (i.e., 50% leverage). As of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, our asset coverage was 237.7% and 225.7% respectively.
	We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after any borrowing or issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly-traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratio at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.
	The 1940 Act imposes limitations on a BDC&#8217;s issuance of preferred stock, which is considered a &#8220;senior security&#8221; and thus is subject to the 200% asset coverage requirement described above.
	Code of Ethics
	As required by the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, we and the Adviser have adopted codes of ethics which apply to, among others, our and our Adviser&#8217;s executive officers, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as well as our Adviser&#8217;s officers, directors and employees. The codes of ethics establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#8217;s requirements. There have been no material changes to the codes or material waivers of the codes that apply to our Co-Chief Executive Officers or Chief Financial Officer.
	We hereby undertake to provide a copy of the codes to any person, without charge, upon request. Requests for a copy of the codes may be made in writing addressed to the Secretary of the Company, Jennifer Gordon, TPG Specialty Lending, Inc., 888 7

	Compliance Policies and Procedures
	We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on certain publicly held companies and their insiders. Assuming certain requirements are met, many of these requirements affect us. For example:
	pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
	pursuant to Item&#160;307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
	pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, subject to certain assumptions, our management is required to prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is required to be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm; and,
	pursuant to Item&#160;308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
	The NYSE Corporate Governance Rules
	The NYSE has adopted corporate governance rules that listed companies must comply with. We believe we are in compliance with these rules.
	Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
	We delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the Adviser and our Independent Directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
	An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, the Adviser recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the Adviser&#8217;s investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section&#160;206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
	The Adviser will vote all proxies based upon the guiding principle of seeking the maximization of the ultimate long-term economic value of our stockholders&#8217; holdings, and ultimately all votes are cast on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the contractual obligations under the relevant advisory agreements or comparable documents, and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote. All proxy voting decisions will require a mandatory conflicts of interest review by our Chief Compliance Officer in accordance with these policies and procedures, which will include consideration of whether the Adviser or any investment professional or other person recommending how to vote the proxy has an interest in how the proxy is voted that may present a conflict of interest. It is the Adviser&#8217;s general policy to vote or give consent on all matters presented to security holders in any proxy, and these policies and procedures have been designed with that in mind. However, the Adviser reserves the right to abstain on any particular vote or otherwise withhold its vote or consent on any matter if, in the judgment of our Chief Compliance Officer or the relevant investment professional(s), the costs associated with voting such proxy outweigh the benefits to our stockholders or if the circumstances make such an abstention or withholding otherwise advisable and in the best interest of the relevant stockholder(s).

	Privacy Principles
	We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of nonpublic personal information relating to investors. The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
	We generally will not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to stockholders who purchase common stock. We may collect nonpublic personal information regarding certain investors from sources such as subscription agreements, investor questionnaires and other forms; individual investors&#8217; account histories; and correspondence between us and individual investors. We may share information that we collect regarding an investor with our affiliates and the employees of such affiliates for legitimate business purposes, for example, to service the investor&#8217;s accounts or provide the investor with information about other products and services offered by us or our affiliates that may be of interest to the investor. In addition, we may disclose information that we collect regarding investors to third parties who are not affiliated with us (i)&#160;as authorized by our investors in investor subscription agreements or our organizational documents; (ii)&#160;as required by law or in connection with regulatory or law enforcement inquiries; or, (iii)&#160;as otherwise permitted by law to the extent necessary to effect, administer or enforce investor transactions or our transactions.
	Any party that receives nonpublic personal information relating to investors from us is permitted to use the information only for legitimate business purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law or regulation. In this regard, our officers, employees and agents and those of our affiliates, access to such information is restricted to those who need such access to provide services to us and our investors. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to seek to guard investor nonpublic personal information.
	Reporting Obligations
	We will furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports, as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act.
	We make available on our website (www.tpgspecialtylending.com) our proxy statements, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We also provide electronic or paper copies of our filings free of charge upon request. Requests may be made in writing addressed to us at 888 7

	Investors and the public may also read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.E., Room 1580 Washington, DC 20549. The public may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains this information.
	Regulated Investment Company Classification
	As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our status as a RIC enables us to deduct qualifying distributions to our stockholders, so that we will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxation only in respect of income and gains that we retain and do not distribute. In addition, certain distributions that we make to non-U.S. stockholders with respect to our taxable years commencing April 1, 2015 will be eligible for look-through tax treatment.
	To maintain our status as a RIC, we must, among other things:
	maintain our election under the 1940 Act to be treated as a BDC;
	derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities and other specified categories of investment income; and
	maintain diversified holdings so that, subject to certain exceptions and cure periods, at the end of each quarter of our taxable year:
	at least 50% of the value of our total gross assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, the securities of other RICs and &#8220;other securities,&#8221; provided that such &#8220;other securities&#8221; shall not include any amount of any one issuer, if our holdings of such issuer are greater in value than 5% of our total assets or greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and
	no more than 25% of the value of our assets may be invested in securities of any one issuer, the securities of any two or more issuers that are controlled by us and are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses (excluding U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs), or the securities of one or more &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships.&#8221;
	27
	To maintain our status as a RIC, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes of an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (which includes, among
	other items, dividends, interest, the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as well as other taxable income, excluding any net capital gains reduced by deductible expenses) and 90% of our net tax-exempt income for th
	at taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to stockholders. In addition, to avoid the imposition of a nondeductibl
	e 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:
	98% of our net ordinary income, excluding certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized during a calendar year;
	98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October&#160;31 of such calendar year; and
	100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.
	We have previously incurred, and can be expected to incur in the future, such excise tax on a portion of our income and gains. While we intend to distribute income and capital gains to minimize exposure to the 4% excise tax, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
	We generally expect to distribute substantially all of our earnings on a quarterly basis, but will reinvest dividends on behalf of those investors that do not elect to receive their dividends in cash. See &#8220;&#8212;
	Dividend Policy
	Dividend Reinvestment Plan
	We may make investments that are subject to tax rules that require us to include amounts in our income before we receive cash corresponding to that income or that defer or limit our ability to claim the benefit of deductions or losses. For example, if we hold securities issued with original issue discount, that original issue discount may be accrued in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments.
	In cases where our taxable income exceeds our available cash flow, we will need to fund distributions with the proceeds of sale of securities or with borrowed money, and may raise funds for this purpose opportunistically over the course of the year.
	In certain circumstances (e.g., where we are required to recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income), we may have difficulty making distributions in the amounts necessary to satisfy the requirements for maintaining RIC status and for avoiding U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Accordingly, we may have to sell investments at times we would not otherwise consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
	If in any particular taxable year, we do not qualify as a RIC, all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to stockholders, and distributions will be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, and distributions would not be required. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next ten years.
	In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the conditions necessary to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.
	ITEM&#160;1A. RISK FACTORS
	Investing in our securities involves a number of significant risks. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware of various risks associated with the investment, including those described below. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us may also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
	28
	Risks Related to Our Business and Structure
	We are dependent upon management personnel of the Adviser, TSSP, TPG and their affiliates for our future success.
	We depend on the experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of senior members of our Investment Team. Our Investment Team, together with other professionals at TSSP and TPG and their affiliates, identifies, evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes, monitors and manages our investments. Our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of the senior members of our Investment Team. The senior members of our Investment Team are not contractually restricted from leaving the Adviser. The departure of any of these key personnel, including members of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Review Committee, could have a material adverse effect on us.
	In addition, we cannot assure you that the Adviser will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to TSSP, TPG or their investment professionals. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty on 60 days&#8217; written notice.
	Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.
	The 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs. See
	ITEM 1. BUSINESS&#8212;Regulation as a Business Development Company
	Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital, and the ways in which we can do so. Raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage, and may result in dilution to our current stockholders. The 1940 Act limits our ability to incur borrowings and issue debt securities and preferred stock, which we refer to as senior securities, requiring that after any borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200%. Consequently, if the value of our assets declines, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when this may be disadvantageous. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders. If we borrow money or issue senior securities, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss.
	If we issue preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure. Preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and may have other rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of our common stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in your best interest. Holders of our common stock will directly or indirectly bear all of the costs associated with offering and servicing any preferred stock that we issue. In addition, any interests of preferred stockholders may not necessarily align with the interests of holders of our common stock and the rights of holders of shares of preferred stock to receive dividends would be senior to those of holders of shares of our common stock.
	Our Board may decide to issue additional common stock to finance our operations rather than issuing debt or other senior securities. However, we generally are not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share We may, however, elect to issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that the sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making these sales within the preceding 12 months. We may in the future seek such approval; however, there is no assurance such approval will be obtained. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of those securities (less any distribution commission or discount). In the event we sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, existing stockholders will experience net asset value dilution. This dilution would occur as a result of the sale of shares at a price below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock and would cause a proportionately greater decrease in the stockholders&#8217; interest in our earnings and assets and their voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. As a result of any such dilution, our market price per share may decline. Because the number of shares of common stock that could be so issued and the timing of any issuance is not currently known, the actual dilutive effect cannot be predicted.
	In addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, we could securitize our investments to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize our investments, we likely would create a wholly owned subsidiary, contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary and have the subsidiary issue primarily investment grade debt securities to purchasers who we would expect would be
	29
	willing to accept a substantially lower interest rate than the loans earn. We would retain all or a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. Our retained equity would be exposed to any losses on the portfolio
	of investments before any of the debt securities would be exposed to the losses. An inability to successfully securitize our investment portfolio could limit our ability to grow or fully execute our business and could adversely affect our earnings, if any.
	The successful securitization of our investment could expose us to losses because the portions of the securitized investments that we would typically retain tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses. The 1940 Act also may impose re
	strictions on the structure of any securitization. In connection with any future securitization of investments, we may incur greater set-up and administration fees relating to such vehicles than we have in connection with financing of our investments in th
	e past. See &#8220;
	Risks Related to Our Portfolio Company Investments
	We may securitize certain of our investments, which may subject us to certain structured financing risks
	.&#8221;
	We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and increases the risk of investing in us.
	As part of our business strategy, we borrow from and may in the future issue additional senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders. Holders of these loans or senior securities would have fixed-dollar claims on our assets that have priority over the claims of our stockholders. If the value of our assets decreases, leverage will cause our net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have without leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause our net income to decline more sharply than it would have if we had not borrowed. This decline could negatively affect our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock. Our ability to service our borrowings depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. In addition, the Management Fee is payable based on our gross assets, including cash and assets acquired through the use of leverage, which may give our Adviser an incentive to use leverage to make additional investments. See &#8220;
	.&#8221; The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our Adviser&#8217;s and our Board&#8217;s assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain credit at all or on terms acceptable to us.
	Our credit facilities also impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities, remedies on default and similar matters. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are in compliance with the covenants of our credit facilities. However, our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, although we believe we will continue to be in compliance, we cannot assure you that we will continue to comply with the covenants in our credit facilities. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default. If we were unable to obtain a waiver of a default from the lenders or holders of that indebtedness, as applicable, those lenders or holders could accelerate repayment under that indebtedness. An acceleration could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Lastly, we may be unable to obtain additional leverage, which would, in turn, affect our return on capital.
	Lastly, the SEC has issued a proposed rule, Rule 18f-4, that if adopted would potentially constrain our ability to use leverage if we have substantial exposure to swaps and other derivatives, or have significant outstanding financial commitments to our portfolio companies. See &#8220;&#8212;
	Risks Related to Our Portfolio Company Investments&#8212;We expose ourselves to risks when we engage in hedging transactions.&#8221;
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had $693.7 million of outstanding indebtedness, which had an annualized interest cost of 2.70% under the terms of our debt, excluding fees (such as fees on undrawn amounts and amortization of upfront fees) and giving effect to the swap-adjusted interest rate on our 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate on our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019, or the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, as adjusted to give effect to the interest rate swaps, was three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 286 basis points.
	For us to cover these annualized interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our investments of at least 1.1%. Since we generally pay interest at a floating rate on our debt, an increase in interest rates will generally increase our borrowing costs. We expect that our annualized interest cost and returns required to cover interest will increase if we issue additional debt securities.

	In order to assist investors in understanding the effects of leverage, the following table illustrates the
	effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. Leverage generally magnifies the return of stockholders when the portfolio return is positive and magnifies their losses when the portfol
	io return is negative. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing below.

	Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations.
	We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before it matures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or seeking additional equity. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would not be disadvantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.
	Legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage.
	As a BDC, under the 1940 Act we generally are not permitted to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock unless immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock is at least 200%. Legislation introduced in the prior congressional session, if reintroduced and if passed, would modify this section of the 1940 Act and increase the amount of debt that BDCs may incur by modifying the asset coverage percentage from 200% to 150%. As a result, we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future and you may face increased investment risk. In addition, since our Management Fee is calculated as a percentage of the value of our gross assets, which includes cash, cash equivalents and any borrowings for investment purposes, our Management Fee expenses will increase if we incur additional indebtedness.
	We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
	Other public and private entities, including commercial banks, commercial financing companies, other BDCs and insurance companies compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. Certain of these competitors may be substantially larger, have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have and offer a wider array of financial services. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors&#8217; pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors&#8217; pricing, terms and structure, however, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.
	In addition, many competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or the restrictions that the Code imposes on us as a RIC. As a result, we face additional constraints on our operations, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result of this existing and potentially increasing competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. The competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective.
	If we are unable to source investments, access financing or manage future growth effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective.
	Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our Investment Team&#8217;s ability to identify, evaluate, finance and invest in suitable companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities, our management of the investment process, our ability to provide efficient services and our access to financing sources on acceptable terms, including equity financing. Moreover, our ability to structure investments may also depend upon the
	31
	participatio
	n of other prospective investors. For example, our ability to offer loans above a certain size and to structure loans in a certain way may depend on our ability to partner with other investors. As a result, we could fail to capture some investment opportun
	ities if we cannot provide &#8220;one-stop&#8221; financing to a potential portfolio company either alone or with other investment partners.
	In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, members of our Investment Team may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. To grow, our Adviser may need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and ability to achieve our investment objective.
	Even in the event the value of your investment declines, the Management Fee and, in certain circumstances, the Incentive Fee will still be payable to the Adviser.
	Even in the event the value of your investment declines, the Management Fee and, in certain circumstances, the Incentive Fee will still be payable to the Adviser. The Management Fee is calculated as a percentage of the value of our gross assets at a specific time, which would include any borrowings for investment purposes, and may give our Adviser an incentive to use leverage to make additional investments. In addition, the Management Fee is payable regardless of whether the value of our gross assets or your investment have decreased. The use of increased leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor holders of our common stock, including investors in offerings of common stock pursuant to this Annual Report. Given the subjective nature of the investment decisions that our Adviser will make on our behalf, we may not be able to monitor this potential conflict of interest.
	The Incentive Fee is calculated as a percentage of pre-Incentive Fee net investment income. Since pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation, it is possible that we may pay an Incentive Fee in a quarter in which we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable Incentive Fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. In addition, because the quarterly minimum hurdle rate is calculated based on our net assets, decreases in our net assets due to realized or unrealized capital losses in any given quarter may increase the likelihood that the hurdle rate is reached in that quarter and, as a result, that an Incentive Fee is paid for that quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the Management Fee.
	Also, one component of the Incentive Fee is calculated annually based upon our realized capital gains, computed net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. As a result, we may owe the Adviser an Incentive Fee during one year as a result of realized capital gains on certain investments, and then incur significant realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on the remaining investments in our portfolio during subsequent years. Incentive Fees earned in prior years cannot be clawed back even if we later incur losses.
	In addition, the Incentive Fee payable by us to the Adviser may create an incentive for the Adviser to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such a compensation arrangement. The Adviser receives the Incentive Fee based, in part, upon capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike the portion of the Incentive Fee that is based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains. As a result, the Adviser may have an incentive to invest more in companies whose securities are likely to yield capital gains, as compared to income-producing investments. Such a practice could result in our making more speculative investments than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during cyclical economic downturns.
	To the extent that we do not realize income or choose not to retain after-tax realized net capital gains, we will have a greater need for additional capital to fund our investments and operating expenses.
	To maintain our status as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year, and may either distribute or retain our realized net capital gains from investments. Unless investors elect to reinvest dividends, earnings that we are required to distribute to stockholders will not be available to fund future investments. Accordingly, we may have insufficient funds to make new and follow-on investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the structure and objectives of our business, we may experience operating losses and expect to rely on proceeds from sales of investments, rather than on interest and dividend income, to pay our operating expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell our investments and thereby fund our operating expenses.
	32
	We will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, including as a result of our failure to satisfy the RIC distribution requirements.
	We will incur corporate-level U.S. federal income tax costs if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including as a result of our failure to satisfy the RIC distribution requirements. Although we have elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to qualify for and maintain RIC status. To maintain RIC status under the Code and to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, we must meet the following annual distribution, income source and asset diversification requirements:
	We must distribute (or be treated as distributing) dividends for tax purposes in each taxable year equal to at least 90% of each of:
	the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses or, investment company taxable income, if any, for that taxable year; and
	our net tax-exempt income for that taxable year.
	The asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under our loan and credit agreements could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, our income for tax purposes may exceed our available cash flow. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we could fail to satisfy the distribution requirements that apply to a RIC. As a result, we could lose our RIC status and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
	We must derive at least 90% of our gross income for each taxable year from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of or other disposition of stock or securities or similar sources.
	We must meet specified asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. The need to satisfy these requirements to prevent the loss of RIC status may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly on unfavorable terms. Because most of our investments will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses.
	If we fail to maintain our qualification for tax treatment as a RIC for any reason, the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution, and the amount of our distributions.
	We can be expected to retain some income and capital gains in excess of what is permissible for excise tax purposes and such amounts will be subject to 4% U.S. federal excise tax.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, we elected to retain approximately $52 million and $38 million of taxable income and capital gains, respectively, in order to provide us with additional liquidity and we recorded a net expense of $2.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax as a result. We can be expected to retain some income and capital gains in the future, including for purposes of providing us with additional liquidity, which amounts would similarly be subject to the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. In that event, we will be liable for the tax on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. See &#8220;
	ITEM 1. BUSINESS&#8212;Regulation as a Business Development Company&#8212;Regulated Investment Company Classification
	Our Adviser and its affiliates, officers and employees may face certain conflicts of interest.
	TSSP and TPG will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us by TSSP and TPG. However, the Adviser, its officers and employees and members of its Investment Review Committee serve or may serve as investment advisers, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as us or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, these individuals may have obligations to investors in those entities or funds, the fulfillment of which might not be in our best interests or the best interests of our stockholders.
	In addition, any affiliated investment vehicle currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Adviser or its affiliates, particularly in connection with any future growth of their respective businesses, may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. For example, TSSP has organized a separate investment vehicle, TSL Europe, aimed specifically at European middle-market loan originations and may in the future organize vehicles aimed at other loan origination opportunities outside our primary focus. Our ability to pursue investment opportunities other than middle-market loan originations for companies domiciled in the United States is subject to the contractual and other requirements of these other funds and allocation decisions by TSSP or TPG senior professionals. As a result, the Adviser and its affiliates may face
	33
	conflicts in allocating investment o
	pportunities between us and those other entities. It is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by other TSSP or TPG vehicles that would otherwise be suitable for us.
	If TPG and the Adviser were to determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more other TSSP or TPG vehicles, we would only be able to make the investment in conjunction with another vehicle to the extent the exemptive order granted to us by the SEC permits us to do so or the investment is otherwise permitted under relevant SEC guidance. On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that, if certain conditions are met, allows us to co-invest with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. These conditions include, among others, prior approval by a majority of our Independent Directors and that the terms and conditions of the investment applicable to any affiliates of TSSP and TPG must be the same as those applicable to us. We cannot assure you when or whether we will apply for any other exemptive relief in the future and whether such orders will be obtained.
	Our Adviser can resign on 60 days&#8217; notice. We may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations and a loss of the benefits from our relationship with TSSP and TPG. Any new investment advisory agreement would require stockholder approval.
	The Adviser has the right, under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, to resign at any time on 60 days&#8217; written notice, regardless of whether we have found a replacement. In addition, our Board has the authority to remove the Adviser for any reason or for no reason, or may choose not to renew the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Furthermore, the Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Adviser. If the Adviser resigns or is terminated, or if we do not obtain the requisite approvals of stockholders and our Board to approve an agreement with the Adviser after an assignment, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption and costs under any new agreements that we enter into could increase. Our financial condition, business and results of operations, as well as our ability to pay dividends, are likely to be adversely affected, and the value of our common stock may decline.
	Any new Investment Advisory Agreement would be subject to approval by our stockholders. Even if we are able to enter into comparable management or administrative arrangements, the integration of a new adviser or administrator and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
	In addition, if the Adviser resigns or is terminated, we would lose the benefits of our relationship with TSSP and TPG, including insights into our existing portfolio, market expertise, sector and macroeconomic views and due diligence capabilities, as well as any investment opportunities referred to us by TSSP and TPG. We also would no longer be able to use TPG&#8217;s name and logo because our license agreement would terminate upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement.
	The Adviser&#8217;s liability is limited under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and we are required to indemnify the Adviser against certain liabilities, which may lead the Adviser to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.
	The Adviser has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the Investment Advisory Agreement, and it will not be responsible for any action of our Board in declining to follow the Adviser&#8217;s advice or recommendations. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it will not be liable to us for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser (except to the extent specified in Section&#160;36(b) of the 1940 Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services).
	We have agreed to the fullest extent permitted by law, to provide indemnification and the right to the advancement of expenses, to each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, because he or she is or was a member, manager, officer, employee, agent, controlling person or any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from acts of the Adviser in the performance of the person&#8217;s duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Our obligation to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses is subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No.&#160;11330, which, among other things, preclude indemnification for any liability (whether or not there is an adjudication of liability or the matter has been settled) arising by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, and require reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification will be made. Despite these limitations, the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses may lead
	34
	the Adviser and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and ot
	her persons and entities affiliated with the Adviser to act in a riskier manner than they would when acting for their own account.
	Any failure to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility.
	If we do not remain a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us.
	We incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.
	As a publicly traded company, we incur legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with corporate governance requirements, such as those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, other rules implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which increases the costs associated with our periodic reporting requirements.
	We are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or our internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our securities.
	We are required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. We may not be able to complete our internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to attest to management&#8217;s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities.
	We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.
	We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as a result of a number of factors, including the pace at which investments are made, rates of repayment, interest rates payable on investments, changes in realized and unrealized gains and losses, syndication and other fees, the level of our expenses and default rates on our investments. As a result of these and other possible factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.
	Provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.
	The General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as our certificate of incorporation, and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of us or the removal of our directors. Among other provisions, we have a staggered board and our directors may be removed for cause only by the affirmative vote of 75% of the holders of our outstanding capital stock. Our Board also is authorized to issue preferred stock in one or more series. In addition, our certificate of incorporation requires the favorable vote of a majority of our Board followed by the favorable vote of the holders of at least 75% of our outstanding shares of common stock, to approve, adopt or authorize certain transactions, including mergers and the sale, lease or exchange of all or any substantial part of our assets with 10% or greater holders of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates or associates, unless the transaction has been approved by at least 80% of our Board, in which case approval by &#8220;a majority of the outstanding voting securities&#8221; (as defined in the 1940 Act) is required. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that stockholders may not take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting and our bylaws provide that any stockholder action required or permitted at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before such meeting. These provisions may also discourage another person or entity from making a tender offer for our common stock, because such person or entity, even if it acquired a majority of our outstanding voting securities, would be able to take action as a stockholder (such as electing new directors or approving a merger) only at a duly called stockholders&#8217; meeting and not by written consent. We also are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. These measures may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders and could have the effect of depriving stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices.
	35
	Certain investors are limited in their ability to make significant investme
	nts in us.
	Investment companies registered under the 1940 Act are restricted from acquiring directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless these funds comply with an exemption under the 1940 Act as well as other limitations under the 1940 Act that would restrict the amount that they are able to invest in our securities. Private funds that are excluded from the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; either pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act are also subject to this restriction. As a result, certain investors may be precluded from acquiring additional shares at a time that they might desire to do so.
	We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.
	Our business is highly dependent on the communications and information systems of the Adviser, its affiliates and third parties. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:
	sudden electrical or telecommunications outages;
	natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;
	disease pandemics;
	events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and
	cyber-attacks.
	These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
	Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.
	A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen information, misappropriation of assets, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships. This could result in significant losses, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. We face risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided to us by third-party service providers. We, our Adviser and its affiliates have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, may be ineffective and do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.
	Third parties with which we do business (including those that provide services to us) may also be sources or targets of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information and assets, as well as certain investor, counterparty, employee and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure or destruction of data, or other cybersecurity incidents, with increased costs and other consequences, including those described above. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may also result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes.
	Our Board may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.
	Our Board has the authority to change our investment objective and modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice (except as required by the 1940 Act) and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be a BDC and we may not withdraw our election as a BDC. We cannot
	36
	predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies or strategies would have on our business, operating resu
	lts and value of our common stock. Nevertheless, the effects may adversely affect our business and impact our ability to pay dividends.
	Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business.
	We and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws and regulations at the local, state, federal and, in some cases, foreign levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain business practices of us or our portfolio companies, negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us or our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies. In particular, changes to the laws and regulations governing BDCs or the interpretation of these laws and regulations by the staff of the SEC could disrupt our business model. In addition, certain members of Congress have put forth proposals that could impact the U.S. federal income tax treatment of debt. The details of these proposals are not sufficiently clear to ascertain their potential impact on our business nor is the likelihood of any such proposals being enacted into law certain at this time. However, if any such proposals were enacted it is possible that they might impact us and our business. Any changes to the laws and regulations governing our operations or the U.S. federal income tax treatment of our assets may cause us to alter our investment strategy to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities. For more information on tax regulatory risks, see &#8220;
	Risks Related to our Portfolio Company Investments.
	On July&#160;21, 2010, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law. Although passage of the Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in extensive rulemaking and regulatory changes that affect us and the financial industry as a whole, many of its provisions remain subject to extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities. While the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on us and our portfolio companies may not be known for an extended period of time, the Dodd-Frank Act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial services industry or affecting taxation that are proposed or pending in the U.S. Congress, may negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us or our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.
	Over the last several years, there has been an increase in regulatory attention to the extension of credit outside of the traditional banking sector, raising the possibility that some portion of the non-bank financial sector will be subject to new regulation.&#160;While it cannot be known at this time whether these regulations will be implemented or what form they will take, increased regulation of non-bank credit extension could negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business.
	Risks Related to Economic Conditions
	The current state of the economy and financial markets increases the likelihood of adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations.
	The U.S. capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years, leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending. For instance, the referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;) in June 2016 has led to disruption and instability in the global markets. Disruptions in the capital markets increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets. Although recent indicators suggest improvement in the capital markets, we cannot assure you that these conditions will not worsen. If conditions worsen, a prolonged period of market illiquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results.
	In addition, to the extent that recessionary conditions return, the financial results of small to mid-sized companies, like those in which we invest, will likely experience deterioration, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults. Additionally, the end markets for certain of our portfolio companies&#8217; products and services have experienced, and continue to experience, negative economic trends. The performances of certain of our portfolio companies have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions, which may ultimately result in:
	our receipt of a reduced level of interest income from our portfolio companies;
	decreases in the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments; and
	ultimately, losses or charge-offs related to our investments.
	37
	Uncertainty about financial stability could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of opera
	tions and financial condition.
	Due to federal budget deficit concerns, S&amp;P downgraded the federal government&#8217;s credit rating from AAA&#160;to AA+ for the first time in history on August&#160;5, 2011. Further, Moody&#8217;s and Fitch warned that they may downgrade the federal government&#8217;s credit rating. Further downgrades or warnings by S&amp;P or other rating agencies, and the government&#8217;s credit and deficit concerns in general, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with our debt portfolio and our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, a decreased credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may weigh heavily on our financial performance and the value of our common stock. Also, to the extent uncertainty regarding any economic recovery in Europe and Brexit continue to negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer credit factors, our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.
	In October 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that it was concluding its bond-buying program, or quantitative easing, which was designed to stimulate the economy and expand the Federal Reserve&#8217;s holdings of long-term securities, suggesting that key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, had showed signs of improvement since the inception of the program. It is unclear what effect, if any, the conclusion of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond-buying program will have on the value of our investments. However, it is possible that, without quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, these developments, along with the United States government&#8217;s credit and deficit concerns and the European sovereign debt crisis, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. Additionally, in December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.25% and, in December 2016, the Federal Reserve further raised the target range by an additional 0.25%. If key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, continue to show signs of improvement, the target range for the federal funds rate may further increase and cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms.
	We are subject to risks associated with our investments in energy companies.
	As of&#160;December&#160;31, 2016, our investments in portfolio companies that operate in the oil, gas and consumable fuels industry represent 2.7% of our total portfolio.&#160;The energy industry has been in a period of disruption and volatility that has been characterized by decreases in oil and gas prices and production levels. This disruption and volatility has led to, and future disruptions and volatility may lead to, decreases in the credit quality and performance of certain of our debt and equity investments in energy companies, which could, in turn, negatively impact the fair value of our investments in energy companies. Any prolonged decline in oil and gas prices or production levels could adversely impact the ability of our portfolio companies in the energy industry to satisfy financial or operating covenants that may be imposed by us and other lenders or to make payments to us as and when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, energy companies are subject to supply and demand fluctuations in the markets in which they operate, which are impacted by numerous factors, including weather, use of renewable fuel sources, natural disasters, governmental regulation and general economic conditions, in addition to the effects of increasing regulation and general operational risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the performance and value of our energy-related investments as well as our cash flows from such investments.
	Risks Related to Our Portfolio Company Investments
	Our investments are very risky and highly speculative.
	We primarily invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt or equity or other securities issued by middle-market companies. The companies in which we intend to invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in these companies are not rated by any rating agency. If these instruments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3, which is often referred to as &#8220;junk&#8221;). Exposure to below investment grade instruments involves certain risks, including speculation with respect to the borrower&#8217;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
	First-Lien Debt
	. When we make a first-lien loan, we generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of its subsidiaries, which we expect to help mitigate the risk that we will not be repaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien is, or could become, subordinated to claims of other creditors. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan&#8217;s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we need to enforce our remedies. In addition, in connection with our &#8220;last out&#8221; first-lien loans, we enter into agreements among lenders. Under these agreements, our interest in the collateral of the first-lien loans may rank junior to those of other lenders in the loan under certain circumstances. This may result in greater risk and loss of principal on these loans.
	38
	Second-Lien and Mezzanine Debt
	. Our investments in second-lien and mezzanine debt gene
	rally are subordinated to senior loans and will either have junior security interests or be unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. This may result in greater risk and loss of principal.
	Equity and Other Investments.
	When we invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt or mezzanine debt, we may acquire equity securities, such as warrants, options and convertible instruments. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. We seek to dispose of these equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of these interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.
	Preferred Stock.
	To the extent we invest in preferred securities, we may incur particular risks, including:
	preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer, at its discretion, to defer distributions for a stated period without any adverse consequences to the issuer. If we own a preferred security that is deferring its distributions, we may be required to report income for U.S. federal income tax purposes before we receive such distributions;
	preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company&#8217;s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and liquidation payments, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk than more senior debt instruments; and
	generally, preferred security holders have no voting rights with respect to the issuing company unless preferred dividends have been in arrears for a specified number of periods, at which time the preferred security holders may elect a number of directors to the issuer&#8217;s board; generally, once all the arrearages have been paid, the preferred security holders no longer have voting rights.
	In addition, our investments generally involve a number of significant risks, including:
	the companies in which we invest may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;
	the companies in which we invest typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors&#8217; actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;
	the companies in which we invest are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;
	the companies in which we invest generally have less predictable operating results, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;
	the debt investments in our portfolio generally have a significant portion of principal due at the maturity of the investment, which would result in a substantial loss to us if such borrowers are unable to refinance or repay their debt at maturity;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	our executive officers, directors and Adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies;
	the companies in which we invest generally have less publicly available information about their businesses, operations and financial condition and, if we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision; and
	the companies in which we invest may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity.
	The value of most of our portfolio securities will not have a readily available market price and we value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, which valuation is inherently subjective, may not reflect what we may actually realize for the sale of the investment and could result in a conflict of interest with the Adviser.
	Investments are valued at the end of each fiscal quarter. The majority of our investments are expected to be in loans that do not have readily ascertainable market prices. The fair value of investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are determined in good faith by the Board, which is supported by the valuation committee of our Adviser and by the
	39
	audit committee of our Board. The Board has retained independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited third-party
	valuation services that the Board identified and requested them to perform. In accordance with our valuation policy, our Investment Team prepares portfolio company valuations using sources or proprietary models depending on the availability of information
	on our investments and the type of asset being valued. The participation of the Adviser in our valuation process could result in a conflict of interest, since the Management Fee is based on the value of our gross assets.
	Factors that we may consider in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#8217;s earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to similar publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because fair valuations, and particularly fair valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and are often based to a large extent on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of private information, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been determined if a ready market for these securities existed. This could make it more difficult for investors to value accurately our portfolio investments and could lead to undervaluation or overvaluation of our common stock. In addition, the valuation of these types of securities may result in substantial write-downs and earnings volatility.
	Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. The effect of all of these factors on our portfolio can reduce our net asset value by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and may suffer unrealized losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
	The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
	We generally make loans to private companies. There may not be a ready market for our loans and certain loans may contain transfer restrictions, which may also limit liquidity. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell positions if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we hold a significant portion of a company&#8217;s equity or if we have material nonpublic information regarding that company.
	Our portfolio may be focused on a limited number of portfolio companies or industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry.
	Our portfolio is currently invested in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries and may continue to be in the near future. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification. While we are not targeting any specific industries, our investments may be focused on relatively few industries. For example, although we classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets, many of our portfolio companies principally provide software products or services, which exposes us to downturns in that sector. As a result, the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could significantly affect our aggregate returns.
	We may securitize certain of our investments, which may subject us to certain structured financing risks.
	Although we have not done so to date, we may securitize certain of our investments in the future, including through the formation of one or more collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, while retaining all or most of the exposure to the performance of these investments. This would involve contributing a pool of assets to a special purpose entity, and selling debt interests in that entity on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to purchasers.
	If we were to create a CLO or other securitization vehicle, we would depend on distributions from the vehicle to pay dividends to our stockholders. The ability of a CLO or other securitization vehicle to make distributions will be subject to various limitations, including the terms and covenants of the debt it issues. For example, tests (based on interest coverage or other financial ratios or other criteria) may restrict our ability, as holder of a CLO or other securitization vehicle equity interest, to receive cash flow from these investments. We cannot assure you that any such performance tests would be satisfied. Also, a CLO or other securitization vehicle may take actions that delay distributions to preserve ratings and to keep the cost of present and future financings lower or the financing vehicle may be obligated to retain cash or other assets to satisfy over-collateralization requirements commonly provided for holders of its debt. As a result, there may be a lag, which could be significant, between the repayment or other realization on a loan or
	40
	other assets in, and the distribution of cash out of, a CLO or other securitization v
	ehicle, or cash flow may be completely restricted for the life of the CLO or other securitization vehicle.
	In addition, a decline in the credit quality of loans in a CLO or other securitization vehicle due to poor operating results of the relevant borrower, declines in the value of loan collateral or increases in defaults, among other things, may force the sale of certain assets at a loss, reducing their earnings and, in turn, cash potentially available for distribution to us for distribution to our stockholders. If we were to form a CLO or other securitization vehicle, to the extent that any losses were incurred by the financing vehicle in respect of any collateral, these losses would be borne first by us as owners of its equity interests. Any equity interests that we were to retain in a CLO or other securitization vehicle would not be secured by its assets and we would rank behind all of its creditors.
	A CLO or other securitization vehicle, if created, also would likely be consolidated in our financial statements and consequently affect our asset coverage ratio, which may limit our ability to incur additional leverage. See &#8220;
	ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#8211; Regulation as a Business Development Company.&#8221;
	Because we generally do not hold controlling interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over those portfolio companies or prevent decisions by management of those portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.
	We are a lender, and loans (and any equity investments we make) typically will be non-controlling investments, meaning we will not be in a position to control the management, operation and strategic decision-making of the companies we invest in (outside of, potentially, the context of a restructuring, insolvency or similar event). As a result, we will be subject to the risk that a portfolio company we do not control, or in which we do not have a majority ownership position, may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the equityholders and management of such a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. We may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event that we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company, and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.
	We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.
	The majority of our debt investments are based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our common stock and our rate of return on invested capital. On one hand, a reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could have an adverse impact on our net interest income, which also could be negatively impacted by our borrowers making prepayments on their loans. On the other hand, an increase in interest rates could increase the interest repayment obligations of our borrowers and result in challenges to their financial performance and ability to repay their obligations.
	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of any investments we hold that earn fixed interest rates, including subordinated loans, senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans and high yield bonds, and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. Moreover, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. Federal Reserve policy, including with respect to certain interest rates and the decision to end its quantitative easing policy, may also adversely affect the value, volatility and liquidity of dividend- and interest-paying securities. Market volatility, rising interest rates and/or a return to unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our business. See &#8220;
	A rise in the general level of interest rates typically leads to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates may result in an increase in the amount of the Incentive Fee payable to the Adviser.
	We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. See &#8220;
	We may not be able to realize expected returns on our invested capital.
	We may not realize expected returns on our investment in a portfolio company due to changes in the portfolio company&#8217;s financial position or due to an acquisition of the portfolio company. If a portfolio company repays our loans prior to their maturity, we may not receive our expected returns on our invested capital. Many of our investments are structured to provide a disincentive for the borrower to pre-pay or call the security, but this call protection may not cover the full expected value of an investment if that investment is repaid prior to maturity.
	41
	Middle-market companies operate in a highly acquisitive market with frequent mergers and buyouts. I
	f a portfolio company is acquired or merged with another company prior to drawing on our commitment, we would not realize our expected return. Similarly, in many cases companies will seek to restructure or repay their debt investments or buy our other equi
	ty ownership positions as part of an acquisition or merger transaction, which may result in a repayment of debt or other reduction of our investment.
	By originating loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, we may be exposed to distressed lending risks.
	As part of our lending activities, we may originate loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Although the terms of such financing may result in significant financial returns to us, they involve a substantial degree of risk. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful financing to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. We cannot assure you that we will correctly evaluate the value of the assets collateralizing our loans or the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a company that we fund, we may lose all or part of the amounts advanced to the borrower or may be required to accept collateral with a value less than the amount of the loan advanced by us to the borrower.
	Our portfolio companies in some cases may incur debt or issue equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in those companies.
	Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt, or issue other equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments. By their terms, those instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our investments. These debt instruments would usually prohibit the portfolio companies from paying interest on or repaying our investments in the event and during the continuance of a default under the debt. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company typically would be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying those holders, the portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of securities ranking equally with our investments, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other security holders in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.
	The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing certain loans we make to our portfolio companies may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements or agreements among lenders. Under these agreements, we may forfeit certain rights with respect to the collateral to holders with prior claims. These rights may include the right to commence enforcement proceedings against the collateral, the right to control the conduct of those enforcement proceedings, the right to approve amendments to collateral documents, the right to release liens on the collateral and the right to waive past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if as a result our rights as lenders are adversely affected.
	We may be exposed to special risks associated with bankruptcy cases.
	One or more of our portfolio companies may be involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Many of the events within a bankruptcy case are adversarial and often beyond the control of the creditors. While creditors generally are afforded an opportunity to object to significant actions, we cannot assure you that a bankruptcy court would not approve actions that may be contrary to our interests. There also are instances where creditors can lose their ranking and priority if they are considered to have taken over management of a borrower.
	The reorganization of a company can involve substantial legal, professional and administrative costs to a lender and the borrower. It is subject to unpredictable and lengthy delays, and during the process a company&#8217;s competitive position may erode, key management may depart and a company may not be able to invest adequately. In some cases, the debtor company may not be able to reorganize and may be required to liquidate assets. The debt of companies in financial reorganization will, in most cases, not pay current interest, may not accrue interest during reorganization and may be adversely affected by an erosion of the issuer&#8217;s fundamental value.
	In addition, lenders can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them where they become too involved in the borrower&#8217;s business or exercise control over the borrower. For example, we could become subject to a lender liability claim (alleging that we misused our influence on the borrower for the benefit of its lenders), if, among other things, the borrower requests significant managerial assistance from us and we provide that assistance.
	42
	Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our investments.
	Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments to:
	increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage;
	exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or
	attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.
	We may elect not to make follow-on investments, may be constrained in our ability to employ available funds, or otherwise may lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. However, doing so could be placing even more capital at risk in existing portfolio companies.
	The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status.
	Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.
	We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of our affiliates without the prior approval of our Independent Directors and, in some cases, exemptive relief from the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we generally are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of our Independent Directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain &#8220;joint&#8221; transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our Independent Directors and, in some cases, exemptive relief from the SEC. If a person acquires more than 25% of our voting securities, we are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such person or certain of that person&#8217;s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates.
	The decision by TSSP, TPG or our Adviser to allocate an opportunity to another entity could cause us to forgo an investment opportunity that we otherwise would have made. We also generally will be unable to invest in any issuer in which TSSP, TPG and its other affiliates or a fund managed by TSSP, TPG or its other affiliates has previously invested or in which they are making an investment. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates. These restrictions may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us.
	On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. We and our affiliates, including investment funds managed by our affiliates, are only permitted to co-invest in accordance with the terms of the exemptive order or in the limited circumstances otherwise currently permitted by regulatory guidance.
	Any acquisitions or strategic investments that we pursue are subject to risks and uncertainties.
	We have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions or strategic investments in new businesses. Completion and timing of any such acquisitions or strategic investments may be subject to a number of contingencies, including the uncertainty in reaching a commercial agreement with our counterparty, our ability to obtain required board, shareholder and regulatory approvals, as well as any required financing (or the risk that these are obtained subject to terms and conditions that are not anticipated). The announcement or consummation of any transaction also may adversely impact our business relationships or engender competitive responses.
	Acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks, such as unanticipated litigation, unexpected costs, liabilities, charges or expenses resulting from a transaction, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs and any changes in general economic or industry specific conditions. There can be no assurance that the integration of an acquired business will be successful or that an acquired business will prove to be profitable or sustainable. The failure to integrate successfully or to manage the challenges presented by an integration process may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the proposal and negotiation of acquisitions or strategic investments, whether or not completed, as well as the integration of those businesses into our existing
	43
	portfolio, could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our Adviser&#8217;s time, attention and resources from our day-to-day operations.
	Our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend, in part, on our success in addressing these risks. Any failure to effectively implement our acquisition or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain various required licenses in U.S. states or in any other jurisdiction where they may be required in the future.
	We are required to have and may be required in the future to obtain various state licenses to, among other things, originate commercial loans, and may be required to obtain similar licenses from other authorities, including outside of the United States, in the future in connection with one or more investments. Applying for and obtaining required licenses can be costly and take several months. We cannot assure you that we will maintain or obtain all of the licenses that we need on a timely basis. We also are and will be subject to various information and other requirements to maintain and obtain these licenses, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy those requirements. Our failure to maintain or obtain licenses that we require, now or in the future, might restrict investment options and have other adverse consequences.
	Our investments in foreign companies may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.
	Our investment strategy may include potential investments in foreign companies. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, U.S. trade policy, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes (potentially at confiscatory levels), less liquid markets, less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. Uncertainty in the wake of Brexit could also have negative impacts on both the U.K. economy and the economies of other countries in Europe. In addition, interest income derived from loans to foreign companies is not eligible to be distributed to our non-U.S. stockholders free from withholding taxes.
	Although most of our investments will be U.S. dollar-denominated, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us.
	We expose ourselves to risks when we engage in hedging transactions.
	We have entered, and may in the future enter, into hedging transactions, which may expose us to risks associated with such transactions. We may seek to utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;and the relative value of certain debt securities from changes in market interest rates. Use of these hedging instruments may include counter-party credit risk. To the extent we have non-U.S. investments, particularly investments denominated in non-U.S. currencies, our hedging costs will increase.
	We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under the second amended and restated senior secured revolving credit agreement, as amended, with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and certain lenders, which we refer to as the Revolving Credit Facility. Instead of entering into a foreign exchange forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate.
	Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions would not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions were to decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions were to increase. It also may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.
	The success of our hedging strategy will depend on our ability to correctly identify appropriate exposures for hedging. To date, we have entered into hedging transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk related to specific portfolio
	44
	companies. In addition, in connection with the offering of our 2019 Convertibl
	e Senior Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. Howeve
	r, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or other exposures that we might hedge may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price
	movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary, as may the time period in which the hedge is effective relative to the time period of the related exposure.
	For a variety of reasons, we may not seek to (or be able to) establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the positions being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. Income derived from hedging transactions also is not eligible to be distributed to non-U.S. stockholders free from withholding taxes. See also &#8220;
	ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Hedging
	.&#8221;
	Recent and anticipated regulatory changes require that certain types of swaps, including interest rate and credit default swaps, be cleared and traded on regulated platforms, and these regulatory changes are expected to apply to foreign exchange transactions in the future. Cleared swaps, such as the interest rate swaps we entered into in connection with our 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, require us to post collateral. Any failure by us to fulfill any collateral requirement (e.g., a so-called &#8220;margin call&#8221;) may result in a default and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. regulators have adopted rules imposing margin requirements for derivatives executed with registered swap dealers that are not cleared. These new requirements could significantly increase the cost of using non-cleared swaps to hedge our interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
	Finally, the SEC has issued a proposed rule, Rule 18f-4, that if adopted would potentially constrain our ability to use swaps and other derivatives. Among other requirements, the proposed rule could potentially force us to reduce our use of leverage if our aggregate exposure to swap or derivative positions, together with outstanding leverage and any financial commitments to our portfolio companies, exceeds 150&#160;percent of our net asset value, absent an assessment that our use of derivatives reduces our actual portfolio risk. In addition, we may be required under the proposed rule to carry sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our actual, and in some cases, expected future, obligations under any swaps or derivatives we currently have in place, which could cause the returns on our overall portfolio to be lower as a result. We cannot assure you when or if the proposed rule will be adopted by the SEC, and if adopted, whether the final rule will similarly constrain our ability to utilize swaps and derivatives in the future.
	If we cease to be eligible for an exemption from regulation as a commodity pool operator, our compliance expenses could increase substantially.
	Our Adviser has been granted relief under a no-action letter, known as Letter 12-40, issued by the staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. Letter 12-40 relieves our Adviser from registering with the CFTC as the commodity pool operator, or CPO, of us, so long as we:
	continue to be regulated by the SEC as a BDC;
	confine our trading in CFTC-regulated derivatives within specified thresholds; and
	are not marketed to the public as a commodity pool or as a vehicle for trading in CFTC-regulated derivatives.
	If we were not to satisfy the conditions of Letter 12-40 in the future, our Adviser may be subject to registration with the CFTC as a CPO. Registered CPOs must comply with numerous substantive regulations related to disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping, and are required to become members of the National Futures Association, or the NFA, and be subject to the NFA&#8217;s rules and bylaws. Compliance with these additional registration and regulatory requirements could increase our expenses and impact performance. The Adviser previously relied on the exemption from registration in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), which is not available for advisers of companies whose stock is marketed to the public.
	Our portfolio investments may present special tax issues.
	Investments in below-investment grade debt instruments and certain equity securities may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about certain issues, including when we may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent certain deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless equity securities, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and interest income, as well as whether
	45
	exchanges of debt instruments in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. These matters could cause us to recognize taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even in the absence of cash or economic gain, and require us to make taxabl
	e distributions to our stockholders to maintain our RIC status or preclude the imposition of either U.S. federal corporate income or excise taxation. Additionally, because such taxable income may not be matched by corresponding cash received by us, we may
	be required to borrow money or dispose of other investments to be able to make distributions to our stockholders. These and other issues will be considered by us, to the extent determined necessary, so that we aim to minimize the level of any U.S. federal
	income or excise tax that we would otherwise incur. See &#8220;
	ITEM 1. BUSINESS
	Regulation as a Business Development Company
	Regulated Investment Company Classification
	If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company, certain U.S. stockholders will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholders&#8217; allocable share of the Management and Incentive Fees paid to our investment adviser and certain of our other expenses, and these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of such U.S. stockholders.
	We expect to be treated as a &#8220;publicly offered regulated investment company&#8221; as a result of shares of our common stock being treated as regularly traded on an established securities market. However, we cannot assure you that we will be treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for all years. For example, if our shares are not treated as regularly traded and we are not held by more than 500 persons at all times during the taxable year, we might not be treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company. If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for any calendar year, each U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholder&#8217;s allocable share of the Management Fees and Incentive Fees paid to our Adviser and certain of our other expenses for the calendar year, and these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of such U.S. stockholder. Miscellaneous itemized deductions generally are deductible by a U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. stockholder&#8217;s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2% of such U.S. stockholder&#8217;s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are not deductible for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under the Code.
	There are certain risks associated with holding debt obligations that have original issue discount or payment-in-kind interest.
	Original issue discount, or OID, may arise if we hold securities issued at a discount, receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan, or in certain other circumstances. OID creates the risk that Incentive Fees will be paid to the Adviser based on non-cash accruals that ultimately may not be realized, while the Adviser will be under no obligation to reimburse us for these fees.
	The higher interest rates of OID instruments reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and OID instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. Even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is supposed to occur at the maturity of the obligation.
	OID instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. OID income may also create uncertainty about the source of our cash dividends.
	For accounting purposes, any cash dividends to stockholders representing OID income are not treated as coming from paid-in capital, even if the cash to pay them comes from the proceeds of issuances of our common stock. As a result, despite the fact that a dividend representing OID income could be paid out of amounts invested by our stockholders, the 1940 Act does not require that stockholders be given notice of this fact by reporting it as a return of capital.
	Payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest has the effect of generating investment income at a compounding rate, thereby further increasing the Incentive Fees payable to the Adviser. Similarly, all things being equal, the deferral associated with PIK interest also increases the loan-to-value ratio at a compounding rate.
	Risks Related to our Securities
	There is a risk that investors in our common stock may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time.
	We intend to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results or maintain a tax status that will allow or require any specified level of cash dividends or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay dividends might be adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this Annual Report. Due to the asset coverage test applicable to us under the 1940 Act as a BDC or restrictions under our credit facilities, we may be limited in our ability to pay dividends. Although a portion of our expected
	46
	earnings and dividend distributions will be attributable to net interest income, we do not expect to generate capital gains from the sale of our portfo
	lio investments on a level or uniform basis from quarter to quarter. This may result in substantial fluctuations in our quarterly dividend payments.
	In some cases where we receive certain upfront fees in connection with loans we originate, we treat the loan as having OID under applicable accounting and tax regulations, even though we have received the corresponding cash. In other cases, however, we may recognize income before or without receiving the corresponding cash, including in connection with the accretion of OID. For other risks associated with debt obligations treated as having OID, see &#8220;
	.&#8221;
	Therefore, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement necessary to qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment under Subchapter M of the Code, even though we may not have received the corresponding cash amount. Accordingly, we may have to sell investments at times we would not otherwise consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate-level income tax.
	To the extent that the amounts distributed by us exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, these excess distributions will be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of a stockholder&#8217;s tax basis in his or her shares and then as capital gain. Reducing a stockholder&#8217;s tax basis will have the effect of increasing his or her gain (or reducing loss) on a subsequent sale of shares.
	The part of the Incentive Fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the Incentive Fee will become uncollectible. Consequently, while we may make Incentive Fee payments on income accruals that we may not collect in the future and with respect to which we do not have a clawback right against our Adviser, the amount of accrued income written off in any period will reduce the income in the period in which the write-off is taken and thereby reduce that period&#8217;s Incentive Fee payment, if any.
	In addition, the middle-market companies in which we intend to invest may be more susceptible to economic downturns than larger operating companies, and therefore may be more likely to default on their payment obligations to us during recessionary periods. Any such defaults could substantially reduce our net investment income available for distribution in the form of dividends to our stockholders.
	Investing in our securities may involve a high degree of risk.
	The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive and, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.
	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.
	The market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:
	significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;
	changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs or BDCs;
	the exclusion of BDC common stock from certain market indices, which could reduce the ability of certain investment funds to own our common stock and put short term selling pressure on our common stock;
	loss of RIC or BDC status;
	changes or perceived changes in earnings or variations in operating results;
	changes in our portfolio of investments;
	changes or perceived changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;
	changes in accounting guidelines governing valuation of our investments;
	any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;
	47
	any downgrades to our credit rating or placement on a negative watch status by a credit rating agency;
	departure of the Adviser&#8217;s or any of its affiliates&#8217; key personnel;
	operating performance of companies comparable to us;
	short-selling pressure with respect to shares of our common stock or BDCs generally;
	future sales of our securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock or the conversion of such securities;
	uncertainty surrounding the strength of the U.S. economic recovery;
	concerns regarding European sovereign debt and Brexit;
	concerns regarding volatility in the Chinese stock market and Chinese currency;
	fluctuations in base interest rates, such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate;
	general economic trends and other external factors; and
	loss of a major funding source.
	We cannot assure you that the market price of shares of our common stock will not decline.
	Shares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value and our stock may also be discounted in the market. This characteristic of closed-end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share of common stock may decline. In the past, shares of BDCs, including at times shares of our common stock, have traded below net asset value. We cannot predict whether our common stock will trade at, above or below net asset value. In addition, if our common stock trades below its net asset value, we will generally not be able to sell additional shares of our common stock to the public at its market price without first obtaining the approval of a majority of our stockholders (including a majority of our unaffiliated stockholders) and our Independent Directors for such issuance.
	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, the availability of such common stock for sale (including as a result of the conversion of our 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and our 2022 Convertible Senior Notes into common stock) or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock. If this occurs, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities should we desire to do so. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of securities or the availability of securities for future sales will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time.
	Our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes.
	Our 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and our 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into&#160;shares of our common stock beginning on June&#160;15, 2019 and February 1, 2022, respectively, or earlier, under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of our 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we have the choice to pay or deliver, as the case may be, at our election, cash,&#160;shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and&#160;shares of our common stock. The initial conversion price of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes is $25.83 per share and the initial conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes is $21.34 per share, in each case taking into account certain de minimis adjustments that will be made on the conversion date and subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances. If we elect to deliver&#160;shares of common stock upon a conversion at the time our tangible book value per share exceeds the conversion price in effect at such time, our stockholders may incur dilution. In addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on&#160;shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance.
	Our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan.
	We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends and distributions declared by the Board on behalf of investors who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other
	48
	distribution. See
	Dividend Policy
	and
	ITEM 1. BUSINESS
	Dividend Reinvestment Plan
	for a description of our dividend policy and obligations.
	In addition, the number of shares issued pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan will be determined based on the market price of shares of our common stock, except in circumstances where the market price exceeds our most recently computed net asset value per share, in which case we will issue shares at the greater of (i)&#160;the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii)&#160;95% of the current market price per share or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share. Accordingly, participants in the dividend reinvestment plan may receive a greater number of shares of our common stock than the number of shares associated with the market price of our common stock, resulting in dilution for other stockholders. Stockholders that opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock over time.
	Purchases of our common stock by us under the Company 10b5-1 Plan may result in the price of our common stock being higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.
	We have entered into an agreement with Goldman, Sachs&#160;&amp; Co., which we refer to as the Company 10b5-1&#160;Plan, in accordance with Rules&#160;10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, under which Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, as agent for us, will buy up to $50 million of our common stock in the aggregate during the period ending on the earlier of the date on which all the capital committed to the plan has been exhausted or February 28, 2017. On February 22, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Whether purchases will be made under the Company 10b5-1 Plan and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. These activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our common stock or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock, and, as a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.
	Purchases of our common stock by us under the Company 10b5-1 Plan may result in dilution to our net asset value per share.
	The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions.
	Because purchases under the Company 10b5-1 Plan are made beginning at any price below our most recently reported net asset value per share, if our net asset value per share as of the end of a quarter is lower than the net asset per share as of the end of the prior quarter, purchases under the Company 10b5-1 Plan during the period from the end of a quarter to the time of our earnings release announcing the new net asset value per share for that quarter may result in dilution to our net asset value per share. This dilution would occur because we would repurchase shares under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a price above the net asset value per share as of the end of the most recent quarter end, which would cause a proportionately smaller increase in our stockholders&#8217; interest in our earnings and assets and their voting interest in us than the decrease in our assets resulting from such repurchase. As a result of any such dilution, our market price per share may decline. The actual dilutive effect will depend on the number of shares of common stock that could be so repurchased, the price and the timing of any repurchases under the Company 10b5-1 Plan.

	U.S. GAAP requires that total return be calculated as the change in net asset value per share during the period plus declared dividends per share, divided by the beginning net asset value per share. Our total return set forth in the table above for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflects the Adviser&#8217;s waivers of its right to receive a portion of the Management Fee and Incentive Fees prior to our IPO and separately with respect to our ownership of shares of common stock of TICC Capital Corp. The Management Fee, excluding the effects of the waivers, would have been $24.3 million, $21.3
	52
	million, $18.3 million, $13.4 million, and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Incentive Fee excluding the effects of the waiver wou
	ld have been $22.7 million and $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at fair value is computed as (a)&#160;the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus additional interest, if any, as a result of arrangements between us and other lenders in any syndication plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount earned on accruing debt and income producing securities, divided by (b)&#160;total debt and income producing securities at fair value. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at amortized cost is computed as (a)&#160;the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus additional interest, if any, as a result of arrangements between us and other lenders in any syndication plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount earned on accruing debt and income producing securities, divided by (b)&#160;total debt and income producing securities at amortized cost.
	ITEM&#160;7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
	Introduction
	Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM&#160;8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.&#8221; Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
	Overview
	TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on July&#160;21, 2010. The Adviser is our external manager. We have three wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, TPG SL SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were used to support our asset-backed credit facility, and TSL MR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments. Our results reflect our ramp-up of initial investments, which is now complete, as well as the ongoing measured growth of our portfolio of investments.
	We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April&#160;15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:
	the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in &#8220;qualifying assets&#8221;;
	source of income limitations;
	asset diversification requirements; and
	the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.
	Our shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;TSLX.&#8221;
	We have in place a stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices below our net asset value over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.
	The Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.
	On August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over a specified period, in accordance with
	53
	the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. On February 22, 2017, our Bo
	ard authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2017. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2017 or such time as the current app
	roved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.
	Our Investment Framework
	We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December&#160;31, 2016, we have originated more than $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.
	By &#8220;middle-market companies,&#8221; we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2016, our core portfolio companies, which excludes certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 88.2% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $144.1 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $31.4 million.
	We invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; &#8220;last out&#8221; first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior &#8220;first out&#8221; first-lien loans; &#8220;unitranche&#8221; loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.
	The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as &#8220;junk&#8221;.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $31.9&#160;million based on fair value.
	The companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). As of December 31, 2016, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 4.5% of our total investment portfolio.
	Through our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:
	Business and sector selection.
	We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50&#160;million and $1&#160;billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.
	We currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, no industry represented more than 22.6% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.
	Investment Structuring.
	We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December&#160;31, 2016, approximately 97.7% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 96.5% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.3 years.
	54
	Deal Dynamics.
	We focus on, among other deal dynamics, direct origination of investments, where we identify and lead the investment transaction. A substantial majority of o
	ur portfolio investments are sourced through our direct or proprietary relationships.
	Risk Mitigation.
	We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future payment income. As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had call protection on 79.9% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 106.7% for the first year, 103.5% for the second year and 101.6% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December&#160;31, 2016, 98.4% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 94.8% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.
	Relationship with our Adviser, TSSP and TPG
	Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser&#8217;s Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly, our Co-Chief Executive Officer Michael Fishman and our Adviser&#8217;s Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, all of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and TPG Special Situations Partners, or TSSP.
	TSSP, with approximately $18 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2016, is TPG&#8217;s special situations and credit platform and encompasses TPG Specialty Lending, TPG Opportunities Partners and TSSP Adjacent Opportunities Partners, which invest in special situations and distressed investments across the credit cycle, TSL Europe, which is aimed at European middle market loan originations, and TPG Institutional Credit Partners, which is a &#8220;public-side&#8221; credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets. TSSP has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 160 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2016, twenty nine (29) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty one (21) investment professionals.
	Our Adviser consults with TSSP and TPG in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The TSSP and TPG platforms provide us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from their market expertise, insights into sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. TSSP and TPG will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us by TSSP and TPG.
	On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested.
	We believe our ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates we will continue to be able to provide &#8220;one-stop&#8221; financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.
	Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser&#8217;s services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.
	Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.

	Key Components of Our Results of Operations
	Investments
	We focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.
	Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.
	In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.
	Revenues
	We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December&#160;31, 2016, 98.4% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 94.8% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, 4.6% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.
	Changes in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities and 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period&#8212;including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period&#8212;often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period&#8212;e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.
	Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly.
	Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.
	Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.
	Expenses
	Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense
	56
	on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:
	calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);
	expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies;
	the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees;
	the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee;
	certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;
	administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement;
	costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs);
	debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements;
	the Adviser&#8217;s allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;
	amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;
	transfer agent and custodial fees;
	costs of hedging;
	commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;
	taxes;
	Independent Director fees and expenses;
	the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders&#8217; meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;
	our fidelity bond;
	directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;
	indemnification payments;
	direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and
	all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.
	We expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines.
	Leverage
	While as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 200% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.
	57
	Market Trends
	We believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates.
	The limited number of providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with expected increases in required capital levels for financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a large number of opportunities for us to originate direct investments in companies. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.
	The limited number of providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.
	An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower&#8217;s distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.
	Portfolio and Investment Activity
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 1.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.6% mezzanine and unsecured debt investments, and 1.7% equity and other investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&#160;31, 2015, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 88.2% first-lien debt investments, 8.1% second-lien debt investments, 1.9% mezzanine and unsecured debt investments and 1.8% equity and other investments.

	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management&#8217;s judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. See

	The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:
	assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;
	periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
	comparisons to other companies in the industry;
	attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and
	review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
	As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:
	An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company&#8217;s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews.
	An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company&#8217;s operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company.
	60
	An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if
	it is paying as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its &#8220;watch list&#8221; and researches any areas of concern with the o
	bjective of early intervention with the portfolio company.
	An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments. For these investments, the Adviser prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees.
	A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout.
	The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company&#8217;s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

	Interest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from $164.6 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $177.8 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016,
	primarily due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. The average size of our investment portfolio increased from $1.4 billion during the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $1.6 billion during the year ended December&#160;31, 2016. Accelerated am
	ortization of upfront fees primarily from unscheduled paydowns decreased from $6.9 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $5.4 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, and prepayment fees decreased from $15.4&#160;million for the year ended Decemb
	er&#160;31, 2015 to $2.6&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and full paydowns on eleven portfolio investments during the year ended
	December 31, 2015 and a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and full paydowns on seven portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividend income increased from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.7 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to owning our dividend yielding investments for a full calendar year. Other income increased from $7.9 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $12.9&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, primarily du
	e to higher syndication, amendment and agency fees earned during 2016.
	Interest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from $154.0 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $164.6 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. The average size of our investment portfolio increased from $1.2 billion during the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $1.4 billion during the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. Accelerated amortization of upfront fees primarily from unscheduled paydowns decreased from $12.5 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $6.9 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015, and prepayment fees decreased from $21.0&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $15.4&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from partial paydowns on two portfolio investments, full paydowns on thirteen portfolio investments and the expiration of one unfunded commitment during the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 and a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and full paydowns on eleven portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. Dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.9 million. We did not have dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other income decreased from $9.3 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $7.9&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015, primarily due to higher syndication, amendment and agency fees earned during 2014.

	Interest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $22.0 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $23.1&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $540.8 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $725.9&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, as well an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 from 0.20% to 0.50% for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.6% for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to 2.7% for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016 due to the increase in LIBOR.
	Interest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $15.1 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $22.0&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $377 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $541&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding for both the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 and the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 was 2.6%.

	Management Fees
	Management Fees (net of waivers) increased from $21.2 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $24.1 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016. Management Fees increased from $21.3&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $24.3 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016 due to the increase in total assets, which increased from an average of $1.4 billion for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to an average of $1.6 billion for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016. Management Fees waived for both the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were $0.1 million. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of TICC Shares.
	Management Fees (net of waivers) increased from $15.8 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $21.2 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. Management Fees increased from $18.3&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $21.3 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 due to the increase in total assets, which increased from an average of $1.2 billion for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to an average of $1.4 billion for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. Management Fees waived decreased from $2.5 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $0.1&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015. There were no Management Fees waived during the period April 1, 2014 through December&#160;31, 2014, following our IPO. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2015 were solely attributable to our ownership of TICC Shares.
	The Adviser has voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TICC Shares for any period in which TICC Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. Following our IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive the full Management Fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will continue to waive Management Fees related to the TICC Shares, as the Adviser can discontinue the voluntary waiver at any time. Accordingly, we may be required to pay the full amount of the Management Fee, including with respect to the TICC Shares, in future periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Incentive Fees
	Incentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase resulted from the increase in the size of the portfolio and related increase in net investment income.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incentive Fees waived related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 due to unrealized losses on our investments and realized losses on our investments.
	Incentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income remained relatively flat at $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Incentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income of $0.2 million were waived, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income waived for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we did not hold any TICC Shares during the period. Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses were ($2.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to unrealized losses on our investments and realized losses on foreign exchange transactions. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to unrealized losses on our investments and realized losses on our investments.
	The Adviser has voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TICC Shares for any period in which TICC Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TICC Shares will be applied towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.
	Any waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will continue to waive any Incentive Fee related to the TICC Shares, as the Adviser can discontinue the voluntary waiver at any time. Accordingly, we may be required to pay the full amount of the Incentive Fee, including with respect to the TICC Shares, in future periods.
	Professional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses
	Professional fees increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in costs associated with servicing our investment portfolio, as well as additional professional fees incurred
	63
	relating to our investment in the TICC shares and related activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other general and administrative fees decreased from $4.8&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015 to $4.4 million for the year ended Dece
	mber&#160;31, 2016.
	Professional fees increased from $4.7 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and other general and administrative fees increased from $3.9&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014 to $4.8 million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2015, both due to an increase in costs associated with servicing a growing investment portfolio, as well as additional professional fees incurred relating to our investment in the TICC shares and related activity.
	Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes
	We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.
	Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.
	For the calendar years ended December&#160;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a net expense of $2.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had net realized losses on investments of $0.8 million and $5.0 million and net realized gains on investments of $0.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2015, we had net realized gains on interest rate swaps of $1.8 million. We did not have realized gains or losses on interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2014. For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016, and 2014, we had net realized losses on foreign currency transactions of $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and net realized gains on foreign currency transactions of less than $0.1 million for the
	64
	year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of translat
	ing foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, and net realized losses on foreign currency forw
	ard contracts of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had net realized losses on foreign currency invest
	ments of $10.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively. We did not have realized gains or losses on foreign currency investments for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 we had net realized gains on foreign
	currency borrowings of $11.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
	For the year ended December 31, 2016 we had $56.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 48 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $23.0 million in unrealized depreciation on 10 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.
	For the year ended December 31, 2015 we had $9.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 15 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $43.3 million in unrealized depreciation on 40 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from widening in credit spreads, the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.
	For the year ended December 31, 2014 we had $5.4 million in unrealized appreciation on 10 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $34.3 million in unrealized depreciation on 35 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to a tightening spread environment during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and positive credit-related adjustments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation, primarily due to a widening spread environment during the six months ended December 31, 2014, and in some instances negative credit-related and energy-related adjustments.
	For the year ended December 31, 2016 we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $3.6 million primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had unrealized appreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $6.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates. For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016 and 2014, we had unrealized appreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on interest rate swaps of $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, due to fluctuations in interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had unrealized appreciation on interest rate swaps of $1.0 million due to fluctuations in interest rates.
	Aggregate Cash Flow Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return
	Since we began investing in 2011 through December&#160;31, 2016, our exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 15.3% (based on cash invested of $1.6 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $2.0 billion). Ninety percent of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.
	Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from the investments. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.
	Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.
	Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.
	65
	Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital
	and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.
	Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.
	Aggregate cash flow realized gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.
	Hedging
	Our current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the necessary local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had $3.6 million of unrealized losses and $6.3 million and $8.9 million of unrealized gains, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2016. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.
	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales of investments denominated in foreign currencies. We bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.
	Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
	Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:
	investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements;
	the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser);
	debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and
	cash dividends to the holders of our shares.
	The capital commitments of our private phase investors terminated upon the completion of our IPO. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200%. As of December&#160;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our asset coverage ratio was 237.7%, 225.7%, and 311.0% respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 200% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.
	Cash and cash equivalents as of December&#160;31, 2016, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had approximately $366.3 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, we used $37.9 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $720.7 million and other operating activity of $49.8 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from investments of $71.4 million, repayments on investments of $524.2 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $137.0 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $40.3 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $580.4 million and proceeds from issuance of
	66
	common stock (net of purchases of treasury stock and offering and underwriting costs) of $76.9 million, partially offset by repayments on debt of $533.8&#160;mil
	lion, debt issuance costs of $2.9 million and dividends paid of $80.3&#160;million.
	As of December&#160;31, 2015, we had $2.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2015, we used $183.5 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $757.3 million and other operating activity of $3.4 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from investments of $39.1 million, repayments on investments of $474.5 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $63.6 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $183.5 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $847.5 million, partially offset by repayments on debt of $584.5&#160;million, debt issuance costs of $1.4 million and dividends paid of $78.1&#160;million.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had $1.1 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $0.9 million as of December 31, 2015.
	Equity
	On March&#160;3, 2016, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $16.42 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, we received total cash proceeds of $78.3 million.
	During the years ended December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, we also issued 638,326 and 368,602 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $10.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively. On February&#160;1, 2017, we issued 122,836 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $2.1 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2015 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
	On November 3, 2014, the Board approved the Company 10b5-1 Plan to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that, in current market conditions, if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.
	The Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.
	The purchase of shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances.
	The Company 10b5-1 Plan expired in accordance with its terms on June 30, 2015. On August 4, 2015, the Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, on substantially the same terms as the prior stock repurchase plan. On February 22, 2017, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2017. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2017 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.
	During the year ended December 31, 2016, 86,081 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $15.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2,000 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $14.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $28.9.

	As of December&#160;31, 2016 and December&#160;31, 2015, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.
	Revolving Credit Facility
	On August&#160;23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders. On July&#160;2, 2013, we entered into an agreement to amend and restate the agreement, effective on July&#160;3, 2013. The amended and restated facility, among other things, increased the size of the facility from $200 million to $350 million. The facility included an uncommitted accordion feature that allowed us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility up to $550 million. On September&#160;30, 2013, we exercised our right under the accordion feature and increased the size of the facility to $400 million. On January&#160;27, 2014, we again exercised our right under the accordion feature and increased the size of the facility to $420 million.
	On February&#160;27, 2014, we further amended and restated the agreement. The second amended and restated agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility), among other things:
	increased the size of the facility to $581.3 million;
	increased the size of the uncommitted accordion feature to allow us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility up to $956.3 million;
	increased the limit for swingline loans to $100 million;
	with respect to $545 million in commitments;
	extended the expiration of the revolving period from June&#160;30, 2017 to February&#160;27, 2018, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility; and
	extended the stated maturity date from July&#160;2, 2018 to February&#160;27, 2019; and
	provided that borrowings under the multicurrency tranche will be available in certain additional currencies.
	On May&#160;30, 2014, we entered into agreements with various financial institutions pursuant to which each of the institutions agreed to provide commitments through the accordion feature of our Revolving Credit Facility, increasing the aggregate commitments from $581.3 million to $781.3 million.
	68
	On June&#160;27, 2014, we further amended the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the $36.3 mil
	lion in commitments not previously extended such that the revolving period as it related to all outstanding commitments would expire on February&#160;27, 2018 and the stated maturity date as it related to all outstanding commitments would be February&#160;27, 2019.
	On October&#160;17, 2014, we entered into a third amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility:
	decreasing the applicable margin with respect to (i)&#160;any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate from 1.25% to 1.00% and (ii)&#160;any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate from 2.25% to 2.00%;
	decreasing the aggregate commitments from $781.3 million to $766.3 million;
	extending the revolving period from February&#160;27, 2018 to October&#160;17, 2018;
	extending the stated maturity date from February&#160;27, 2019 to October&#160;17, 2019; and
	increasing the sublimit applicable to letters of credit from $20 million to $100 million.
	On October&#160;23, 2014, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which the institution agreed to provide commitments through the accordion feature, increasing the aggregate commitments from $766.3 million to $776.3 million. On November 3, 2014, an existing lender agreed to increase their commitment through the accordion feature, increasing aggregate commitments from $776.3 million to $781.3 million.
	On October&#160;2, 2015, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility:
	decreasing the applicable margin with respect to (i) any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate from 1.00% to 0.75% and (ii) any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate from 2.00% to 1.75%, in each case, if the Borrowing Base is equal to or greater than 1.85 times the Combined Debt Amount;
	increasing the aggregate commitments from $781.3 million to $821.3 million;
	extending the revolving period from October 17, 2018 to October&#160;2, 2019;
	extending the stated maturity date from October 17, 2019 to October&#160;2, 2020; and
	increasing the accordion feature, which allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility, from a maximum of $956.3 million to a maximum of $1.25 billion.
	On December 10, 2015, TPG SL SPV, LLC became a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility.
	On December&#160;22, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility:
	increasing the aggregate commitments from $821.3 million to $945.0 million;
	with respect to $885.0 million in commitments,
	extending the revolving period from October&#160;2, 2019 to December 22, 2020; and
	extending the stated maturity date from October&#160;2, 2020 to December 22, 2021.
	We may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had outstanding debt denominated in Euro (EUR) of 47.1&#160;million and Pound&#160;Sterling (GBP) of 13.3&#160;million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.
	Amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. We may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then-applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.
	The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by TPG SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and TSL MR, LLC and may be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries in the future. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.
	69
	The Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of de
	fault, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants requiring:
	an asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter;
	a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility; and
	stockholders&#8217; equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after December&#160;22, 2016.
	Net proceeds received from our IPO, the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option from the IPO, and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.
	SPV Asset Facility
	On May&#160;8, 2012, the Closing Date, our wholly owned subsidiary TPG SL SPV, LLC, entered into a credit and security agreement with Natixis, New York Branch. Also on May&#160;8, 2012, we contributed certain investments to TPG SL SPV pursuant to the terms of a Master Sale and Contribution Agreement by and between us and TPG SL SPV. We consolidate TPG SL SPV in our consolidated financial statements, and no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the contribution. Proceeds from the SPV Asset Facility were permitted to be used to finance the acquisition of eligible assets by TPG SL SPV, including the purchase of such assets from us. We retain a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by TPG SL SPV through our ownership of TPG SL SPV. The facility size was subject to availability under the borrowing base, which was based on the amount of TPG SL SPV&#8217;s assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test, an asset quality test and certain concentration limits.
	The credit and security agreement provided for a contribution and reinvestment period for up to 18 months after the Closing Date, or the Commitment Termination Date. The Commitment Termination Date was November&#160;8, 2013, at which point the reinvestment period of the SPV Asset Facility expired and accordingly any undrawn availability under the facility terminated. The reinvestment period was subsequently reopened for the period from January 21, 2014 to January 21, 2015, thereby extending the Commitment Termination Date to January 21, 2015. Proceeds received by TPG SL SPV from interest, dividends or fees on assets were required to be used to pay expenses and interest on outstanding borrowings, and the excess could be returned to us, subject to certain conditions, on a quarterly basis. Prior to the Commitment Termination Date, proceeds received from principal on assets could be used to pay down borrowings or make additional investments. Following the Commitment Termination Date, proceeds received from principal on assets were required to be used to make payments of principal on outstanding borrowings on a quarterly basis. Proceeds received from interest and principal at the end of a reporting period that have not gone through the settlement process for these payment obligations are considered to be restricted cash.
	After giving effect to amendments to the credit and security agreement in January 2014 and March 2015, the facility had commitments of $175 million and the pricing ranged from cost of funds plus 225 basis points to LIBOR plus 235 basis points and the facility was scheduled to mature on January 21, 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The undrawn portion of the commitment bore an unutilized commitment fee of 0.75%. This fee ceased to accrue on January&#160;21, 2015 when the reinvestment period ended. The SPV Asset Facility contained customary covenants, including covenants relating to separateness from the Adviser and its affiliates and long-term credit ratings with respect to the underlying collateral obligations, and events of default. The SPV Asset Facility was secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the assets of TPG SL SPV and on any payments received by TPG SL SPV in respect of such assets, which accordingly were not available to pay our other debt obligations.
	On September 25, 2015, TPG SL SPV prepaid all loans outstanding under the facility and the facility was terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the facility, the security interests in the assets of TPG SL SPV and on payments received by TPG SL SPV in respect of such assets were released.
	2019 Convertible Senior Notes
	On June&#160;10, 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due December 2019, or the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 4.50%&#160;per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on December&#160;15, 2019. In certain circumstances, the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 38.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000
	70
	principal amount of 2019 Convertible
	Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.83 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The sale of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $1
	10.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates
	of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points.
	Holders may convert their 2019 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to June&#160;15, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1)&#160;during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September&#160;30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2)&#160;during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3)&#160;upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
	On or after June&#160;15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.
	The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
	As of December 31, 2016, the principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock.
	The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the requirement under the 1940 Act that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equal at least 200% and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the terms of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture.
	The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes was recorded in &#8220;additional paid-in capital&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.
	2022 Convertible Senior Notes
	On February 1, 2017, we issued in a private offering $100 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the &#8220;2022 Convertible Senior Notes&#8221;). On February 3, 2017, we issued an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment option to purchase additional notes granted to the initial purchasers. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, at the Company&#8217;s election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $110.6 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes issuances to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility.
	71
	On February 1, 2017, in connect
	ion with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes,
	we
	entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a notional amount of $115 million.
	We pay
	three-month LIBOR plus 237.2 basis points and receives fixed rate interest at 4.50%. The swap trans
	action matures on August 1, 2022.
	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
	Portfolio Company Commitments
	From time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower&#8217;s demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower&#8217;s demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December&#160;31, 2016 and&#160;2015, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of December 31, 2015.
	We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.
	Under the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.

	In addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.
	Distributions
	We have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:
	investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and
	net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year.
	As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.
	We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.
	Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:
	98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year;
	98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October&#160;31 of that calendar year; and
	100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.
	While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
	We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.
	To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.
	We have adopted an &#8220;opt out&#8221; dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not &#8220;opted out&#8221; of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders
	73
	who
	receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.
	Related-Party Transactions
	We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:
	the Investment Advisory Agreement;
	the Administration Agreement; and
	a license agreement with an affiliate of TPG under which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive license to use the TPG name and logo, for a nominal fee, for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the &#8220;TPG&#8221; name or logo.
	Critical Accounting Policies
	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in
	Investments at Fair Value
	Investment transactions purchased on a secondary basis are recorded on the trade date. Loan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.
	Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.
	As part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including:
	the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total fair value of the portfolio company&#8217;s debt and equity);
	the nature and realizable value of any collateral;
	the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow;
	the markets in which the portfolio company does business;
	a comparison of the portfolio company&#8217;s securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and
	overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future.
	When an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.
	74
	The Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:
	The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team.
	The Adviser&#8217;s management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee.
	The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board.
	The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties.
	We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.
	In connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform.
	We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820,
	Fair Value Measurement
	(&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:
	Level 1&#8212;Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
	Level 2&#8212;Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
	Level 3&#8212;Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality.
	Our accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.
	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.
	Interest and Dividend Income Recognition
	Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.
	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management&#8217;s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due
	75
	principal and interest is paid current and, in management&#8217;s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of
	collection.
	Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.
	Our accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.
	U.S. Federal Income Taxes
	We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
	We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company&#8217;s 2015, 2014 and 2013 tax year returns remain subject to examination by the relevant federal and state tax authorities.
	Our accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results.
	ITEM&#160;7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
	We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
	Valuation Risk
	We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.
	Interest Rate Risk
	Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We also fund portions of our investments with borrowings. Our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.
	We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate-sensitive assets to our interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016, 98.4% of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 94.8% of these subject to interest rate floors. Our credit facilities also bear interest at floating rates, and in connection with our 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate; we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps in order to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio.
	76
	Assuming that our consolidated balance sheet as of December&#160;31, 2016 were to remain constant and that we too
	k no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments):
	($ in millions)

	6.9
	8.9
	Down 25 basis points
	(0.3
	)
	(1.6
	)
	1.3
	Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.
	We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.
	Currency Risk
	From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us.&#160;We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our Revolving Credit Facility. Instead of entering into a foreign exchange forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
	The Board of Directors and Stockholders
	TPG Specialty Lending, Inc.:
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. (and subsidiaries) (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. We also have audited TPG Specialty Lending, Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
	Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013)
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, by correspondence with custodians, or by other appropriate auditing procedures. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
	A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the balance sheets of TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. (and subsidiaries), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
	Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013)
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
	(Amounts in thousands, unless otherwise indicated)
	1. Organization and Basis of Presentation
	Organization
	TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. (&#8220;TSLX&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation formed on July&#160;21, 2010. The Company was formed primarily to lend to, and selectively invest in, middle-market companies in the United States. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company (&#8220;BDC&#8221;) under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (&#8220;RIC&#8221;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). TSLX is managed by TSL Advisers, LLC (the &#8220;Adviser&#8221;). On June&#160;1, 2011, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. On March&#160;22, 2012, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TPG SL SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;TPG SL SPV&#8221;). On May&#160;19, 2014, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TSL MR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
	On March&#160;21, 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;TSLX.&#8221;
	Basis of Presentation
	The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. In the opinion of management all adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented, have been included. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
	Certain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position or its results of operations as previously reported.
	The Company is an investment company and, therefore, applies the specialized accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 946,
	Financial Services &#8211; Investment Companies.
	Fiscal Year End
	The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on December&#160;31.
	2. Significant Accounting Policies
	Use of Estimates
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material.
	Cash and Cash Equivalents
	Cash and cash equivalents may consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments (e.g., money market funds, U.S. Treasury notes, and similar type instruments) with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with highly-rated banking corporations and, at times, cash deposits may exceed the insured limits under applicable law.
	Investments at Fair Value
	Investment transactions purchased on a secondary basis are recorded on the trade date. Loan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.
	F-16
	Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quot
	ations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not read
	ily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, the Company&#8217;s Audit Comm
	ittee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.
	As part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of its investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total value of the portfolio company&#8217;s net debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company&#8217;s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.
	The Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:
	The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team.
	The Adviser&#8217;s management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee.
	The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board.
	The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties including independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.
	The Company currently conducts this valuation process on a quarterly basis.
	In connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform. At December&#160;31, 2016, the independent third-party valuation firms performed their procedures over substantially all of the Company&#8217;s investments. Upon completion of such limited procedures, the third-party valuation firms determined that the fair value, as determined by the Board, of those investments subjected to their limited procedures, appeared reasonable.
	The Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820,
	Fair Value Measurement
	Level&#160;1&#8212;Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
	Level&#160;2&#8212;Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
	Level&#160;3&#8212;Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company applies the valuation policy approved by its Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Company subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, the Company reviews pricing provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices
	F-17
	obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality, such as the depth of the relevant market relative to the size of the Company&#8217;s position.
	Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company&#8217;s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.
	In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.
	Financial and Derivative Instruments
	The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated financial statements. Derivative contracts entered into by the Company are not designated as hedging instruments, and as a result the Company presents changes in fair value through current period earnings.
	In the normal course of business, the Company has commitments and risks resulting from its investment transactions, which may include those involving derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are measured in terms of the notional contract amount and derive their value based upon one or more underlying instruments. While the notional amount gives some indication of the Company&#8217;s derivative activity, it generally is not exchanged, but is only used as the basis on which interest and other payments are exchanged. Derivative instruments are subject to various risks similar to non-derivative instruments including market, credit, liquidity, and operational risks. The Company manages these risks on an aggregate basis as part of its risk management process.
	Derivatives, including the Company&#8217;s interest rate swaps, for which broker quotes are available are typically valued at those broker quotes.
	Offsetting Assets and Liabilities
	Foreign currency forward contract and interest rate swap receivables or payables pending settlement are offset, and the net amount is included with receivable or payable for foreign currency forward contracts or interest rate swaps in the consolidated balance sheets when, and only when, they are the same counterparty, the Company has the legal right to offset the recognized amounts, and it intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	Foreign Currency
	Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:
	cash and cash equivalents, market value of investments, outstanding debt on revolving credit facilities, other assets and liabilities: at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and
	purchases and sales of investments, borrowings and repayments of such borrowings, income and expenses: at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.
	Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, the Company does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments. The Company&#8217;s current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in its non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under the Company&#8217;s Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluctuations arising from the translation of foreign currency borrowings are included with the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the consolidated statements of operations.
	Investments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin, including unanticipated movements in the value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
	F-18
	Equity Offering Expenses
	The Company records expenses related to registration statement filings and applicable offering costs as deferred financing costs in other assets and a portion of these expenses are charged as a reduction of capital upon each such offering.
	Debt Issuance Costs
	The Company records origination and other expenses related to its debt obligations as deferred financing costs, which are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. These expenses are deferred and amortized using the effective yield method, or straight-line method, over the stated maturity of the obligation.
	Interest and Dividend Income Recognition
	Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased or originated are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.
	Unless providing services in connection with an investment, such as syndication, structuring or diligence, all or a portion of any loan fees received by the Company will be deferred and amortized over the investment&#8217;s life using the effective yield method.
	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30&#160;days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management&#8217;s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management&#8217;s judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.
	Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.
	Other Income
	From time to time, the Company may receive fees for services provided to portfolio companies by the Adviser. The services that the Adviser provides vary by investment, but generally include syndication, structuring or diligence fees, and fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and are recognized as revenue when earned.
	Reimbursement of Transaction-Related Expenses
	The Company may receive reimbursement for certain transaction-related expenses in pursuing investments. Transaction-related expenses, which are expected to be reimbursed by third parties, are typically deferred until the transaction is consummated and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets on the date incurred. The costs of successfully completed investments not otherwise reimbursed are borne by the Company and included as a component of the investment&#8217;s cost basis. Subsequent to closing, investments are recorded at fair value at each reporting period.
	Cash advances received in respect of transaction-related expenses are recorded as cash and cash equivalents with an offset to Other liabilities or Payables to affiliates. Other liabilities or Payables to affiliates are relieved as reimbursable expenses are incurred.
	Income Taxes
	The Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC&#160;under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company&#8217;s stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
	The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet
	F-19
	the &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; threshold are reserved and
	recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense.&#160;Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on fa
	ctors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.
	Dividends to Common Stockholders
	Dividends to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the Adviser. Net realized long-term capital gains, if any, would be generally distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
	The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any dividends declared in cash on behalf of stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and it declares, a cash dividend, then the stockholders who have not &#8220;opted out&#8221; of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend. The Company expects to use newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan.
	Accounting Standards Adopted in 2016
	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 (&#8220;ASU 2015-03&#8221;), &#8220;Interest &#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.&#8221; ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred assets, separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement requirements for debt issuance costs.&#160;ASU 2015-03&#160;is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and adjusted prior period balance sheets to reflect the change. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or cash flows. See Note 7, &#8220;Debt&#8221; for additional disclosures required under this guidance.
	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014&#8211;15 (&#8220;ASU 2014-15&#8221;), &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements &#8211; Going Concern (Subtopic 205 &#8211; 40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.&#8221; ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December&#160;31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
	New Accounting Pronouncements
	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;), &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).&#8221; The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,&#160;Revenue Recognition. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for public companies for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
	In November 2016, the&#160;Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18 (&#8220;ASU 2016-18&#8221;),&#160;&#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):&#160; Restricted Cash.&#8221;&#160; The standard requires an entity&#8217;s reconciliation of the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows to include in cash and cash equivalents amounts generally described as&#160;restricted cash&#160;and&#160;restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

	3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions
	Administration Agreement
	On March&#160;15, 2011, the Company entered into the Administration Agreement with the Adviser. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser provides administrative services to the Company. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, the Adviser is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties and the Company pays or reimburses the Adviser for certain expenses incurred by any such affiliates or third parties for work done on its behalf.
	For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred expenses of $3.1 million, $3.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for administrative services payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.
	In November 2016, the Board renewed the Administration Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until November 2017, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60&#160;days&#8217; written notice to the other party.
	The Administration Agreement was subsequently amended on February 22, 2017 to make certain clarifications to the agreement, including with respect to the scope of the costs and expenses of the Administrator&#8217;s services. In February 2017, the Board approved an amendment to the Administration Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until February&#160;2018, and may be extended subject to required approvals.
	No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to the Company&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other professionals who spend time on such related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company). Directors who are not affiliated with the Adviser receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings.
	Investment Advisory Agreement
	On April&#160;15, 2011, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement was subsequently amended on December&#160;12, 2011. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will provide investment advisory services to the Company. The Adviser&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser the Management Fee and may also pay certain Incentive Fees.
	The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% based on the average value of the Company&#8217;s gross assets calculated using the values at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears.
	For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Management Fees were $24.3 million, $21.3 million and $18.3 million, respectively.
	Prior to the Company&#8217;s initial public offering ( the &#8220;IPO&#8221;), the Adviser had waived its right to receive the Management Fee in excess of the sum of (i)&#160;0.25% of aggregate committed but undrawn capital; and, (ii)&#160;0.75% of aggregate drawn capital (including capital drawn to pay Company expenses) as determined as of the end of any calendar quarter (the &#8220;Pre-IPO Waiver&#8221;).
	In addition, the Adviser has voluntarily waived the Management Fee on the Company&#8217;s ownership of shares of common stock in TICC Capital Corp. (the &#8220;TICC Shares&#8221;) for any period in which TICC Capital Corp. remains a portfolio company of the Company.
	For the year ended December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, Management Fees of $0.1 million, and $0.1 million, respectively, were waived, consisting solely of Management Fees attributable to the Company&#8217;s ownership of the TICC shares. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Management Fees of $2.5 million were waived pursuant to the Pre-IPO Waiver. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
	F-21
	The Incentive Fee consists of two parts, as follows:
	(i)
	Through March 31, 2014, the quarter in which the Company completed its IPO, the first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equaled 100% of the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a 1.5% quarterly &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser had received 15% of the total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and, for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.76% quarterly, 15% of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The 100% &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the 1.5% &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 15% on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals 1.76% in a quarter (7.04% annualized), which is the rate at which catch-up was achieved. Once the &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is reached and catch-up is achieved, 15% of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.76% in any quarter is payable to the Adviser.
	Beginning April 1, 2014, the first quarter after the Company&#8217;s IPO, the first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equals 100% of the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a 1.5% quarterly &#8220;hurdle rate,&#8221; the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser has received 17.5% of the total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and, for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% quarterly, 17.5% of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The 100% &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the 1.5% &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals 1.82% in a quarter (7.28% annualized), which is the rate at which catch-up is achieved. Once the &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; is reached and catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% in any quarter is payable to the Adviser.
	Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income means dividends, interest and fee income accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter, minus the Company&#8217;s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to the Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company may not have received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
	(ii)
	The second component, payable at the end of each fiscal year in arrears, equaled 15% through March 31, 2014, and beginning April 1, 2014,&nbsp;&nbsp;equals a weighted percentage of cumulative realized capital gains from the Company&#8217;s inception to the end of that fiscal year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. This component of the Incentive Fee is referred to as the Capital Gains Fee. Each year, the fee paid for this component of the Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee for prior periods. For capital gains that accrue following March 31, 2014, the Incentive Fee rate is 17.5%. The Company accrues, but does not pay, a capital gains Incentive Fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains Incentive Fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. The weighted percentage is intended to ensure that for each fiscal year following the completion of the IPO, the portion of the Company&#8217;s realized capital gains that accrued prior to March 31, 2014, is subject to an incentive fee rate of 15% and the portion of the Company&#8217;s realized capital gains that accrued beginning April 1, 2014 is subject to an incentive fee rate of 17.5%.
	To determine whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, prior to the IPO, the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income was expressed as a rate of return on an average daily hurdle calculation value. The average daily hurdle calculation value, on any given day, equaled
	net assets as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the day; plus
	the aggregate amount of capital drawn from investors (or reinvested pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan) from the beginning of the current quarter to the day; minus
	the aggregate amount of distributions (including share repurchases) made by the Company from the beginning of the current quarter to the day (but only to the extent the distributions were not declared and accounted for on its books and records in a previous quarter).
	Following the IPO, for purposes of determining whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-Incentive Fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company&#8217;s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
	The Company accrues the Incentive Fee taking into account unrealized gains and losses; however, Section&#160;205(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, prohibits the Adviser from receiving the payment of fees until those gains are realized, if ever. There can be no assurance that such unrealized gains will be realized in the future.
	F-22
	For the year ended December 31, 2016, Incentive Fees were $22.7 million which were realized and payable to th
	e Adviser. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Incentive Fees were $20.2 million which were realized and payable to the Adviser. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2014, Incentive Fees were $17.8 million, of which $20.8 million were realized and payable to
	the Adviser.
	The Adviser has voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by the Company as a result of the Company&#8217;s ownership of the TICC Shares for any period in which TICC Capital Corp. remains a portfolio company of the Company. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Capital Gains Fee attributable to the Company&#8217;s ownership of the TICC Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the TICC Shares will be applied against the Company&#8217;s cumulative realized capital gains on which the Capital Gains Fee is calculated.
	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Incentive Fees of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, were waived, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to the Company&#8217;s ownership of the TICC Shares. For the year ending December 31, 2014 no Incentive Fees were waived, as the Company did not hold any TICC Shares during such periods. Any waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
	Since the Company&#8217;s IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees and certain Incentive Fees attributable to the Company&#8217;s ownership of the TICC Shares, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive any Management Fees or Incentive Fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will continue to waive Management Fees or Incentive Fees related to the Company&#8217;s ownership of the TICC Shares, as the Adviser can discontinue the voluntary waiver at any time. Accordingly, the Company may be required to continue to pay the full amount of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee, including with respect to the TICC Shares, in future periods.
	In November&#160;2016, the Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2017, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60&#160;days&#8217; written notice to the other party.
	From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by the Company to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and the Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms.
	4. Investments at Fair Value
	Under the 1940 Act, the Company is required to separately identify non-controlled investments where it owns 5% or more of a portfolio company&#8217;s outstanding voting securities as investments in &#8220;affiliated&#8221; companies and/or had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. In addition, under the 1940 Act, the Company is required to separately identify investments where it owns more than 25% of a portfolio company&#8217;s outstanding voting securities and/or had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company as investments in &#8220;controlled&#8221; companies. Detailed information with respect to the Company&#8217;s non-controlled, non-affiliated; non-controlled, affiliated; and controlled affiliated investments is contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the consolidated schedules of investments. The information in the tables below is presented on an aggregate portfolio basis, without regard to whether they are non-controlled non-affiliated, non-controlled affiliated or controlled affiliated investments.

	5. Derivatives
	Foreign Currency
	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales of investments denominated in foreign currencies or to help mitigate the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company&#8217;s investments denominated in foreign currencies. A foreign currency forward contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current forward exchange rate as of the measurement date as
	F-24
	unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. The forei
	gn currency forward contracts that the Company enters into typically have terms of approximately two months or less. Risks may arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company attempts to
	limit this risk by dealing with only creditworthy counterparties.
	During the year ended December&#160;31, 2016, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales of investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company did not have any open foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	All realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are included in unrealized and realized gains and losses within the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are also included in net unrealized gains (losses) within the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets.
	The Company has not been required to post cash collateral related to its foreign currency forward contracts, but may be required to do so in the future.
	Interest Rate Swaps
	In June 2014, in connection with the issuance of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes,&#160;the Company entered into two interest rate swap transactions, each with a $57.5 million notional amount. As of December 31, 2014 the Company received fixed rate interest at 4.50% and paid variable rate interest based on the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) plus 252.9 basis points.
	In January 2015, the Company closed out its existing interest rate swaps and simultaneously entered into new interest rate swaps realizing a cash payment of $2.0 million and increasing pricing to three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points. The new swap transactions mature on December&#160;15, 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In November 2015, in connection with a fixed rate investment, the Company entered into two interest rate swap transactions, each with a $46.3 million notional amount. The Company receives three-month LIBOR and pays fixed rate interest at 1.16%. the swap transactions mature on October 5, 2018.
	The following tables present the gross and net information on the Company&#8217;s interest rate swap transactions that are eligible for offset in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets as of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015:

	The notional amount of certain interest rate swaps may exceed the Company&#8217;s investment in individual portfolio companies as a result of arrangements with other lenders in the syndicate.
	During the years ended December&#160;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company received $5.2 million, $5.2 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, and paid $4.1 million, $3.7 million, and $1.6 million, respectively, related to the quarterly settlements of its $115 million notional amount interest rate swap. The net amounts of these settlements are reductions to interest expense in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations.
	During the year ended December&#160;31, 2016 the Company received $0.5 million and paid $1.1 million related to the quarterly settlements of its $92.5 million notional amount interest rate swap. The net amounts of these settlements are a reduction to interest income in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations.
	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized ($0.3) million and ($0.6) million, respectively, in unrealized depreciation on derivatives in the consolidated statement of operations related to the swap transactions. As of December 31,&#160;2016, and 2015, the swap transactions had a fair value of $0.1 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, which is included in receivable for interest rate swaps on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet.
	The Company is required under the terms of its derivatives agreements to pledge assets as collateral to secure its obligations under the derivatives. The amount of collateral required varies over time based on the mark-to-market value, notional amount and remaining term of the derivatives, and may exceed the amount owed by the Company on a mark-to-market basis. Any failure by the Company to fulfill any collateral requirement (e.g., a so-called &#8220;margin call&#8221;) may result in a default. In the event of a default by a counterparty, the Company would be an unsecured creditor to the extent of any such overcollateralization. As of December&#160;31, 2016, $1.1 million of cash is pledged as collateral under the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments and is included in restricted cash as a component of other assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also had $0.9 million of cash collateral posted as of December&#160;31, 2015, which is also included in restricted cash as a component of other assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet.
	The Company may enter into other derivative instruments and incur other exposures with the same or other counterparties in the future.

	The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing Level 3 debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of our investment within each portfolio company&#8217;s capital structure.
	Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically considered in the fair value measurement of the Company&#8217;s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers,
	F-28
	dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an enterprise value analysis may be used to value such debt investments; ho
	wever, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Company&#8217;s Level 3 equity investments, multiples of similar companies&#8217; revenues, earnings befo
	re income taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions are typically used.
	Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value
	Debt
	The fair value of the Company&#8217;s Revolving Credit Facility, which is categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as of December&#160;31, 2016, approximates its carrying value as the outstanding balance is callable at carrying value.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, which is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as of December&#160;31, 2016, was $117.6 million, based on broker quotes received by the Company.
	Other Financial Assets and Liabilities
	The carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, other than investments at fair value and 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, approximate fair value due to their short maturities or their close proximity of the originations to the measurement date. Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 while the Company&#8217;s other assets and liabilities, other than investments at fair value and Revolving Credit Facility, are classified as Level 2.
	7. Debt
	In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, the Company is allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. As of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company&#8217;s asset coverage was 237.7% and 225.7% respectively.

	Revolving Credit Facility
	On August 23, 2012, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders. On July&#160;2, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to amend and restate the agreement, effective on July 3, 2013. The amended and restated facility, among other things, increased the size of the facility from $200 million to $350 million. The facility included an uncommitted accordion feature that allowed the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility up to $550&#160;million. On September&#160;30, 2013, the Company exercised its right under the accordion feature and increased the size of the facility to $400 million. On January&#160;27, 2014, the Company again exercised its right under the accordion feature and increased the size of the facility to $420 million.
	On February 27, 2014, the Company further amended and restated the agreement. The second amended and restated agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility), among other things:
	increased the size of the facility to $581.3 million;
	increased the size of the uncommitted accordion feature to allow the Company, under certain circumstances to increase the size of the facility up to $956.3 million;
	increased the limit for swingline loans to $100 million;
	with respect to $545 million in commitments,
	extended the expiration of the revolving period from June 30, 2017 to February 27, 2018, during which period the Company, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, and
	extended the stated maturity date from July 2, 2018 to February 27, 2019; and
	provided that borrowings under the multicurrency tranche will be available in certain additional currencies.
	On May&#160;30, 2014, the Company entered into agreements with various financial institutions pursuant to which each of the institutions agreed to provide commitments through the accordion feature of the Revolving Credit Facility, increasing the aggregate commitments from $581.3 million to $781.3 million.
	On June&#160;27, 2014, the Company further amended the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the $36.3 million in commitments not previously extended such that the revolving period as it related to all outstanding commitments would expire on February&#160;27, 2018 and the stated maturity date as it related to all outstanding commitments would be February&#160;27, 2019.
	On October&#160;17, 2014, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility:
	decreasing the applicable margin with respect to (i)&#160;any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate from 1.25% to 1.00% and (ii)&#160;any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate from 2.25% to 2.00%;
	decreasing the aggregate commitments from $781.3 million to $766.3 million;
	extending the revolving period from February&#160;27, 2018 to October&#160;17, 2018;
	extending the stated maturity date from February&#160;27, 2019 to October&#160;17, 2019; and
	increasing the sublimit applicable to letters of credit from $20 million to $100 million.

	On October&#160;2, 2015, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility:
	decreasing the applicable margin with respect to (i) any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate from 1.00% to 0.75% and (ii) any loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate from 2.00% to 1.75%, in each case, if the Borrowing Base is equal to or greater than 1.85 times the Combined Debt Amount;
	increasing the aggregate commitments from $781.3 million to $821.3 million;
	extending the revolving period from October 17, 2018 to October&#160;2, 2019;
	extending the stated maturity date from October 17, 2019 to October&#160;2, 2020; and
	increasing the accordion feature, which allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility, from a maximum of $956.3 million to a maximum of $1.25 billion.
	On December 10, 2015, TPG SL SPV, LLC became a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility.
	On December&#160;22, 2016, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility:
	increasing the aggregate commitments from $821.3 million to $945.0 million;
	with respect to $885.0 million in commitments,
	extending the revolving period from October&#160;2, 2019 to December 22, 2020; and
	extending the stated maturity date from October&#160;2, 2020 to December 22, 2021.
	The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December&#160;31, 2016, the Company had outstanding debt denominated in Euro (EUR) of 47.1&#160;million and Pound&#160;Sterling (GBP) of 13.3&#160;million on its Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The Company may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The Company also pays a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.
	The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by TPG SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and TSL MR, LLC and may be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries in the future. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by the Company and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.
	The Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants requiring:
	an asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter;
	a liquidity test under which the Company must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where the Company&#8217;s adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of the Company&#8217;s adjusted borrowing base under the facility; and
	stockholders&#8217; equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after December 22, 2016.
	Net proceeds received from the Company&#8217;s IPO, the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option from the IPO, and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.

	SPV Asset Facility
	On May 8, 2012, the &#8220;Closing Date,&#8221; the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary TPG SL SPV, LLC, entered into a credit and security agreement with Natixis, New York Branch. Also on May 8, 2012, the Company contributed certain investments to TPG SL SPV pursuant to the terms of a Master Sale and Contribution Agreement by and between the Company and TPG SL SPV. The Company consolidates TPG SL SPV in its consolidated financial statements, and no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the contribution. Proceeds from the SPV Asset Facility were permitted to be used to finance the acquisition of eligible assets by TPG SL SPV, including the purchase of such assets from the Company. The Company retains a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by TPG SL SPV through its ownership of TPG SL SPV. The facility size was subject to availability under the borrowing base, which was based on the amount of TPG SL SPV&#8217;s assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test, an asset quality test and certain concentration limits.
	The credit and security agreement provided for a contribution and reinvestment period for up to 18 months after the Closing Date, or the Commitment Termination Date. The Commitment Termination Date was November 8, 2013, at which point the reinvestment period of the SPV Asset Facility expired and accordingly any undrawn availability under the facility terminated. The reinvestment period was subsequently reopened for the period from January 21, 2014 to January 21, 2015, thereby extending the Commitment Termination Date to January 21, 2015. Proceeds received by TPG SL SPV from interest, dividends or fees on assets were required to be used to pay expenses and interest on outstanding borrowings, and the excess could be returned to the Company, subject to certain conditions, on a quarterly basis. Prior to the Commitment Termination Date, proceeds received from principal on assets could be used to pay down borrowings or make additional investments. Following the Commitment Termination Date, proceeds received from principal on assets were required to be used to make payments of principal on outstanding borrowings on a quarterly basis. Proceeds received from interest and principal at the end of a reporting period that have not gone through the settlement process for these payment obligations are considered to be restricted cash.
	After giving effect to amendments to the credit and security agreement in January 2014 and March 2015, the facility (as amended, the &#8220;SPV Asset Facility&#8221;)&nbsp;&nbsp;had commitments of $175 million and the pricing ranged from cost of funds plus 225 basis points to LIBOR plus 235 basis points and the facility was scheduled to mature on January 21, 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The undrawn portion of the commitment bore an unutilized commitment fee of 0.75%. This fee ceased to accrue on January 21, 2015 when the reinvestment period ended. The SPV Asset Facility contained customary covenants, including covenants relating to separateness from the Adviser and its affiliates and long-term credit ratings with respect to the underlying collateral obligations, and events of default. The SPV Asset Facility was secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the assets of TPG SL SPV and on any payments received by TPG SL SPV in respect of such assets, which accordingly were not available to pay the Company&#8217;s other debt obligations.
	On September 25, 2015, TPG SL SPV prepaid all loans outstanding under the facility and the facility was terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the facility, the security interests in the assets of TPG SL SPV and on payments received by TPG SL SPV in respect of such assets were released.
	2019 Convertible Senior Notes
	On June&#160;10, 2014, the Company issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due December 2019 (the &#8220;2019 Convertible Senior Notes&#8221;). The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50%&#160;per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on December&#160;15, 2019. In certain circumstances, the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, at the Company&#8217;s election, at an initial conversion rate of 38.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.83 per share of the Company&#8217;s common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The sale of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of its liabilities with its investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, the Company&#8217;s effective interest rate on the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points. See Note 5 for further information related to the Company&#8217;s interest rate swaps.
	Holders may convert their 2019 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to June&#160;15, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1)&#160;during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September&#160;30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
	F-32
	quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each
	applicable trading day; (2)&#160;during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the &#8220;measurement period&#8221;) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 princip
	al amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company&#8217;s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3)&#160;upon the occurrence of specified corpo
	rate events. On or after June&#160;15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circ
	umstances.
	The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to the Company&#8217;s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment to the Company&#8217;s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company&#8217;s secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
	For the years ended December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, the components of interest expense related to the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were as follows:

These net amounts are reductions to interest expense in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations. In January 2015, the Company closed out its existing interest rate swaps and simultaneously entered into new interest rate swaps, realizing a cash payment of $2.0 million and increasing pricing to three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points. Please see Note 5 for further information about the Company&#8217;s interest rate swaps.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock.

Please see Note 5 for further information about the Company&#8217;s interest rate swaps.
	The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to comply with the requirement under the 1940 Act that the Company&#8217;s asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equal at least 200% and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture. As of December&#160;31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture.
	The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, the Company intends to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, the Company has the option to pay in cash or shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes Indenture. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion option in the 2019 Convertible

	Senior Notes a
	re not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, the Company estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. An
	original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes was recorded in &#8220;additional paid-in capital&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2019 Convertible S
	enior Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.
	As of December&#160;31, 2016 and December&#160;31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the terms of its debt obligations.
	8. Commitments and Contingencies
	Portfolio Company Commitments
	From time to time, the Company may enter into commitments to fund investments; such commitments are incorporated into the Company&#8217;s assessment of its liquidity position. The Company&#8217;s senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower&#8217;s demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. The Company&#8217;s senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower&#8217;s demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement.

	9. Net Assets
	In March 2016, the Company issued a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $16.42 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, the Company received total cash proceeds of $78.3 million.
	The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan, whereby the Company may buy shares of its common stock in the open market or issue new shares in order to satisfy dividend reinvestment requests. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a stockholder by the market price per share of the Company&#8217;s common stock at the close of regular trading on the NYSE on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, the Company will issue shares at the greater of (i)&#160;the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii)&#160;95% of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). Shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator will be allocated to a stockholder based on the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of common stock purchased in the open market.
	Pursuant to the Company&#8217;s dividend reinvestment plan, the following tables summarize the shares issued to stockholders who have not opted out of the Company&#8217;s dividend reinvestment plan during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. All shares issued to stockholders in the tables below are newly issued shares.

	On November&#160;3, 2014, the Company&#8217;s Board approved a stock repurchase plan (the &#8220;Company 10b5-1 Plan&#8221;) to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of the Company&#8217;s common stock at prices just below the Company&#8217;s net asset value per share over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.
	The Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., as agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company&#8217;s behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by the Company to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of the Company&#8217;s common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases&nbsp;&nbsp;depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of the common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.
	The purchase of shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances.
	On August 3, 2016, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to February 28, 2017. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of February 28, 2017 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.
	F-35
	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 86,081 shares under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $
	15.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2,000 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $14.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total c
	ost of $28.9. On February 22, 2017, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 3, 2017.
	On December 3, 2013, the Board approved a stock split in the form of a stock dividend pursuant to which the Company&#8217;s stockholders of record as of December 4, 2013 received 65.676 additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock held. The Company distributed the shares on December 5, 2013 and paid cash for fractional shares without interest or deduction. For dates prior to December 3, 2013, the Company has retroactively applied the effect of the stock split to the financial information presented herein by multiplying numbers of shares outstanding by 66.676 and dividing per share amounts by 66.676.
	10. Earnings per share
	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:
	Year Ended
	December&#160;31,&#160;2016
	December&#160;31,&#160;2015
	December&#160;31,&#160;2014
	Increase in net assets resulting from operations
	137,007

	Weighted average shares of common stock
	58,591,380

	50,509,692
	Earnings per common share&#8212;basic and diluted
	2.34
	1.18
	1.68
	For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per common share, the average closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for the year ended December&#160;31, 2016&#160;was less than the conversion price for the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes outstanding as of December&#160;31, 2016. Therefore, for all periods presented in the financial statements, the underlying shares for the intrinsic value of the embedded options in the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes have no impact on the computation of diluted earnings per common share.
	11. Dividends

	96,067
	104,020
	Note: Taxable income is an estimate and is not fully determined until the Company&#8217;s tax return is filed.
	Taxable income generally differs from increase in net assets resulting from operations due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized gains or losses, as unrealized gains or losses are generally not included in taxable income until they are realized.
	The Company makes certain adjustments to the classification of stockholders&#8217; equity as a result of permanent book-to-tax differences, which include differences in the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, and nondeductible federal taxes or losses among other items. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged or credited to additional paid in capital, undistributed net investment income or undistributed net realized gains on investments, as appropriate. In addition, due to the Company&#8217;s differing fiscal, tax, and excise tax year ends, the best estimates available are recorded to the above accounts in the period that such differences arise or are identifiable.
	During the year ended December 31, 2016, permanent differences were principally related to $2.3 million of recharacterization of income for tax purposes between ordinary income and capital gains, $1.8 million attributable to accrued U.S. federal excise taxes, $1.0 million of recharacterization of prepayment penalties for tax purposes between ordinary income and capital gains, and $0.4 million attributable to the foreign currency reclassifications. During the year ended December 31, 2015, permanent differences were principally related to $13.8&nbsp;&nbsp;million of recharacterization of prepayment penalties for tax purposes between ordinary income and capital gains, $1.2 million attributable to accrued U.S. federal excise taxes, and $0.1 million attributable to the foreign currency reclassifications. During the year ended December 31, 2014, permanent differences were principally related to $19.9 million of recharacterization of prepayment penalties for tax purposes between ordinary income and capital gains, $1.1 million attributable to accrued U.S. federal excise taxes, and $0.2 million attributable to the foreign currency reclassifications.
	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $3.1 million pertaining to operating losses, related to one of its investments. Given the losses generated by the entity, the deferred tax asset has been offset by a valuation allowance of $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $1.5 million pertaining to unrealized depreciation and a $1.6 million deferred tax asset pertaining to operating losses, related to one of its investments. Given the losses generated by the entity, the deferred tax assets have been offset by valuation allowances of $1.5 million and $1.6 million for the deferred tax asset generated from unrealized depreciation and operating income, respectively. There were no deferred tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2014.
	The tax cost of the Company&#8217;s investments as of December&#160;31, 2016 and 2015, approximates their amortized cost.

	The ratio of net expenses to average net assets in the table above reflects the Adviser&#8217;s waivers of its right to receive a portion of the Management Fee and Incentive Fees with respect to the Company&#8217;s ownership of shares of common stock of TICC Capital Corp. Excluding the effects of waivers, the ratio of net expenses to average net assets would have been 9.43% and 9.33% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company&#8217;s did not own any shares of common stock of TICC Capital Corp. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the ratio of net expenses to average net assets in the table above reflects the Adviser&#8217;s waivers of its right to receive a portion of the Management Fee prior to our IPO. Excluding the effects of the waiver, the ratio of net expenses to average net assets would have been 7.88%, 7.94% and 8.03% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

	15. Subsequent Events
	On February 1, 2017, the Company issued in a private offering $100 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the &#8220;2022 Convertible Senior Notes&#8221;). On February 3, 2017, the Company issued an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment option to purchase additional notes granted to the initial purchasers. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, at the Company&#8217;s election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $110.6 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes issuances to pay down debt under its Revolving Credit Facility.
	On February 1, 2017, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a notional amount of $115 million. The Company pays three-month LIBOR plus 237.2 basis points and receives fixed rate interest at 4.50%. The swap transaction matures on August 1, 2022.

	None.
	ITEM&#160;9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act.
	Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in
	Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013)
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework). Based on our evaluation under the framework in
	Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework
	, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&#160;31, 2016.
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
	Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
	Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is set forth under the heading &#8220;Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm&#8221; on page F-2.
	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Bank or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank;
	provided
	that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank&#8217;s fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties hereto expressly agree that:

	provided
	that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

	provided
	that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), resign as an Issuing Bank hereunder upon not less than three Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower;

	lable on such date in accordance with
	paragraph (a)
	ilable to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
	made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i)&#160;in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii)&#160;in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such Le

	Increased Costs Generally
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Change in Law shall:
	(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate)&#160;or any Issuing Bank; or
	(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
	and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan)&#160;or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
	(b)
	Capital Requirements
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s capital or on the capital of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

	Delay in Requests
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section&#160;shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s right to demand such compensation;
	provided
	that the
	Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the
	Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor;
	provided

	(i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan denominated in the Currency of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation)&#160;if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Currency for such Interest Period,
	over
	(ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in such Currency from other banks in the Eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period.
	Payment under this Section&#160;shall be made upon request of a Lender delivered not later than five Business Days following the payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section&#160;accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

	Indemnification by the Lenders
	. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the ex
	tent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of
	Sect
	ion 9.04(f)
	relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expense
	s arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administ

	Section 2.16(f)(ii)
	below) shall not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

	(z) any other form including Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY as applicable prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
	claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be mad

	(g)
	Documentation Required by FATCA
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such document prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their respective obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Solely for purposes of this

	provided
	that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
	clause (h)
	, in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to Borrower pursuant to this
	clause (h)
	, the payment of which would place such Person in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;This subsection&#160;shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential)&#160;to the Borrower or any other Person.

	Presumptions of Payment
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
	(f)
	Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent

	(a)
	Designation of a Different Lending Office
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Lender requests compensation under

	, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
	Section&#160;2.16
	, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i)&#160;would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
	Section&#160;2.14
	or
	2.16
	, as the case may be, in the future and (ii)&#160;would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
	(b)

	Section&#160;2.16
	, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a Non-Consenting Lender (as provided in
	Section 9.02(d)
	), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
	Section&#160;9.04

	Certain Fees
	.
	(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee pursuant to
	Sections 2.11(a)

	Revolving Credit Agreement
	(iii)
	Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fron
	ting Exposure
	. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated (effective no later than one (1) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge that such Lender has be
	come a Defaulting Lender) among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Dollar Percentages and Applicable Multicurrency Percentages, as the case may be (in each case calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Co
	mmitment), but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in
	Section 4.02
	are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed to have repre
	sented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Commitment. Subject to
	Section 9.17
	,
	no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such N
	on-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s increased exposure following such reallocation.
	(iv)
	Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swingline Loans
	. If the reallocation described in
	clause (iii)
	above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall not later than two (2) Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of any Issuing Bank and/or any Swingline Lender), without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders&#8217; Swingline Exposure (which exposure shall be deemed equal to the applicable Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the total outstanding Swingline Exposure (other than Swingline Exposure as to which such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation obligation has been reallocated to other Lenders or Cash Collateralized in accordance with the terms hereof)) and (y) second, Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in
	Section 2.19(d)
	or (z) make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lenders in their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender.
	(b)
	Defaulting Lender Cure
	. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that such former Defaulting Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the applicable Commitments (without giving effect to
	Section 2.19(a)(iii)
	), and if Cash Collateral has been posted with respect to such Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will promptly return or release such Cash Collateral to the Borrower, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
	provided
	that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
	provided
	,
	further
	, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.
	(c)
	New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit
	. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that the participations therein will be fully allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with
	clause (a)(iii)
	above and the Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein and (ii) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that the participations in any existing Letters of Credit as well as the new, extended, renewed or increased Letter of Credit has been or will be fully allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with
	clause (a)(iii)
	above and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein except to the extent such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation has been or will be fully Cash Collateralized in accordance with
	Section 2.19(d)
	.
	(d)
	Cash Collateral
	. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, promptly following the written request of Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy to Administrative Agent) Borrower shall Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to
	Section 2.19(a)(iii)
	and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.
	(i)
	Grant of Security Interest
	. Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders&#8217; obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit, to be applied pursuant to
	clause (ii)
	below. If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum
	722276124 11299570

	Revolving Credit Agreement
	Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an
	amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).&nbsp;&nbsp;All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-in
	terest bearing deposit accounts at SunTrust. Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all reasonable and customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cas
	h Collateral.
	(ii)
	Application
	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this
	Section 2.19
	in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
	(iii)
	Termination of Requirement
	. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this
	Section 2.19
	following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender) or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
	provided
	that, subject to the other provisions of this
	Section 2.19
	, the Person providing Cash Collateral and each Issuing Bank may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure;
	provided
	,
	further
	, that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.

	are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause (I) the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Extending Lender to exceed such Extending Lender&#8217;s Commitment, (II) the total Revolving Dollar Credit Exposures of Dollar Lenders with Dollar Commitments then in effect to exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments at such time, or (III) the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures of Multicurrency Lenders with Multicurrency Commitments then in effect to exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments at such time.
