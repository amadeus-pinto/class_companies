RBC Bearings, Inc. manufactures and markets bearings and components, which are integral to the manufacture and operation of most machines and mechanical systems, reduce wear to moving parts, facilitate proper power transmission and reduce damage and energy loss caused by friction. It operates through the following segments: Plain Bearings, Roller Bearings, Ball Bearings and Engineered Products. The Plain Bearings segment products are produced with either self-lubricating or metal-to-metal designs and consists of several sub-classes, including rod end bearings, spherical plain bearings and journal bearings. Its products are primarily used to rectify inevitable misalignments in various mechanical components, such as aircraft controls, helicopter rotors, or in heavy mining and construction equipment. The Roller Bearings segment products are anti-friction bearings that use rollers instead of balls. This segment offers tapered roller bearings, needle roller bearings and needle bearing track rollers and cam followers. The Ball Bearings segment consists of precision aerospace bearings, which are primarily sold to customers in the defense industry that require technically sophisticated bearing products, such as missile guidance systems; airframe control ball bearings, which are precision ball bearings that are plated to resist corrosion and are qualified under a military specification; thin section ball bearings, which are specialized bearings that use extremely thin cross sections and also produces a general line of industrial ball bearings sold primarily to the aftermarket. The Engineered Products segment consists of engineered hydraulics and valves, fasteners, precision mechanical components and machine tool collets. The company was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Oxford, CT.
