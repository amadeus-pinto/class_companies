The company engages in developing antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) products comprising IMMU-132, an ADC that contains SN-38, which is in Phase II trials used for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancers; IMMU-130, an anti-CEACAN5-SN-38 ADC that is in Phase II trials for the treatment of solid tumors and metastatic colorectal cancer; and epratuzumab, a humanized antibody that targets CD22, an antigen found on the surface of B lymphocytes. Its early-stage products include IMMU-114, a novel humanized antibody for the treatment of patients with B-cell and other cancers; Milatuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting tumors that expresses the CD74 antigen, which is present on various hematological tumors and solid cancers; Veltuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 receptors on B lymphocytes for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and autoimmune diseases; and Yttrium-90-Labeled Epratuzumab Tetraxetan, a radiolabeled anti-CD22 investigational product. The company also provides LeukoScan, a diagnostic imaging product for diagnostic imaging to determine the location and extent of infection/inflammation in bone. In addition, it offers other product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, as well as other diseases, which are in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development. The company has a research collaboration with The Bayer Group to study epratuzumab as a thorium-227-labeled antibody.
