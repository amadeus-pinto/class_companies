Bio-Techne Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures, and sells biotechnology reagents, instruments, and clinical diagnostic controls worldwide. The company operates through three segments: Biotechnology, Clinical Controls, and Protein Platforms. The Biotechnology segment provides proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes; polyclonal antibodies in goats, sheep, and rabbits, as well as monoclonal antibodies; microtiter-plate based kits, immunoassays based on encoded bead technology and planar spotted surfaces, and microfluidic-based immunoassays to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids; and erythropoietin, transferrin receptor, and Beta2-microglobulin immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices. This segment also offers fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits to determine the immuno-phenotypic properties of cells from various tissues; and natural or synthetic chemical compounds for use as agonists, antagonists, and/or inhibitors of various biological functions. The Clinical Controls segment provides hematology controls and calibrators for hematology clinical instruments; clinical controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices, as well as coagulation device control products; and bulk purified proteins, enzymes, disease-state plasmas, infectious disease antigens, and processed serums to the clinical diagnostic industry. The Protein Platforms segment develops, manufactures, and sells tools comprising Simple Western platform, an assay for protein analysis and identification; SimplePlex platform, an assay used in research and clinical diagnostics; and Biologics Instrumentation to interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics. The company was formerly known as Techne Corporation and changed its name to Bio-Techne Corporation in November 2014. Bio-Techne Corporation was founded in 1976 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
