II-VI Incorporated develops, manufactures, and sells engineered materials and optoelectronic components and products worldwide. It operates through three segments: II-VI Laser Solutions, II-VI Photonics, and II-VI Performance Products. The company offers precision infrared optoelectronic components, such as lenses, output couplers, windows, mirrors, and scan-lenses for use in CO2 and fiber lasers; and tools for laser materials processing, including modular laser processing heads for fiber lasers, direct diode lasers, and other one-micron laser systems, as well as fiber optic cables and modular beam systems. It also provides semiconductor laser and low-power polarization locked laser diodes products; laser cutting machines; laser gain materials, optics, optical components, and optical module assemblies; crystal components; and solid state and fiber lasers. In addition, the company offers assemblies, modules, transceivers, and monitor products; pump laser diodes; optical modules; optical components and assemblies for ultraviolet, visible, and infrared systems, such as windows, domes, laser rods and optics, and related sub-assemblies; and zinc sulfide, gallium arsenide, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, selenium, telluride, bismuth telluride, and silicon. Further, it provides thermoelectric modules and assemblies; metal matrix composites and reaction bonded ceramics products; and single crystal silicon carbide substrates, and polycrystalline chemical vapor deposition diamond materials. The company markets and sells its products through a direct sales force, representatives, and distributors. II-VI Incorporated was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania.
