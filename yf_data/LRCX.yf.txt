Lam Research Corporation designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. It provides thin film deposition products, including SABRE electrochemical deposition products for copper damascene manufacturing; ALTUS systems to deposit conformal atomic layer films for tungsten metallization applications; VECTOR plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition systems to deposit oxides, nitrides, carbides, multiple patterning films, anti-reflective layers, multi-layer stack films, and diffusion barriers; SPEED high-density plasma CVD products for applications in shallow trench isolation, pre-metal dielectrics, inter-layer dielectrics, inter-metal dielectrics, and passivation layers; and SOLA ultraviolet thermal processing products for the treatment of back-end-of-line low-k dielectric films and front-end-of-line silicon nitride strained films. The company also offers plasma etch products, such as Kiyo products that provide solutions for conductor etch applications; Flex products, which offer technologies and application-focused capabilities for dielectric etch applications; and Syndion products that provide solutions to address various through-silicon via etch applications. In addition, it provides single-wafer clean products, including EOS, Da Vinci, DV-Prime, and SP series products for wet etch and clean applications in wafer-level packaging, including silicon substrate thinning, wafer stress relief, underbump metallization etch, and photoresist removal; and Coronus plasma-based bevel clean products to enhance die yield by removing particles, residues, and unwanted films from the waferÂ’s edge, as well as legacy products. The company offers its products in the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia. Lam Research Corporation was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Fremont, California.
